The specified call to reject must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the [call:operation][19] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][22]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][22] event, that the
   call was rejected.

**Parameters**

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
   state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the [call:operation][19] event.

   user.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the [call:operation][19] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][27]
   event after the operation completes.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][5]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **(SIP_URI | TEL_URI)** The destination to forward the call to.

### consultativeTransfer

Performs a "consultative" transfer between two ongoing calls (also known
   as an announced or warm transfer). This allows the current user to
   transfer the remote participant of a call to another user, after
   having spoken to both users.

Both calls used for the transfer must be locally held. After the
   operation, these calls will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][22] event.

Both remote participants will see their call be unheld by the operation,
   as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][22] event, and will
   be connected to one another afterwards.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][19] event. Both local
   calls will receive this event, since it is an operation on both calls,
   and the remote calls will receive it as if it were a "remote unhold"
   operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][5]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][5]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### directTransfer

Performs a "direct" transfer on a call (also known as an unannounced or
   blind transfer). This allows the current user to transfer the remote
   participant of a call to another user, similar to a "forward"
   operation.

The specified call must be locally held. After the operation, this call
   will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][22] event.

The "destination" user will receive an incoming call, and when answered,
   they will be connected with the remote participant of the specified
   call.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][19] event. The remote
   participant being transferred will receive it as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][5]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **(SIP_URI | TEL_URI)** The destination to transfer the call to.

### join

Performs a "join" on two ongoing calls.
This allows the current user to establish a call with audio with two
   remote users.

Both specified calls must be locally held. The new, "joined" call will be
   audio-only, even if either previous call had video. Video cannot be
   added to the "joined" call. Both remote participants will see their
   call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
   participants after the operation. Both previous calls for the current
   user will be ended after the operation, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][22] event.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][19] event. Both remote
   participants will also receive this event as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][5]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][5]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the [call:operation][19] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][28] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][5]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][5]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][4]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][7]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][4]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **MediaConstraint?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][7]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][4]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **MediaConstraint?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **MediaConstraint?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **MediaConstraint?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **MediaConstraint?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][29], which can be
   retrieved using the [call.getById][10] or
   [call.getAll][14] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][22]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][5]** The (outgoing) call is being started.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][5]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received.
-   `RINGING` **[string][5]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][5]** The call has not been answered, but media
       is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
       system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
       supported, this state may replace the Ringing state.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][5]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][5]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][5]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][5]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // Render call media ...
   }
})
```

The logger can provide two types of logs: basic logs and action logs. Basic
logs are simple lines of information about what the SDK is doing during operations.
Action logs are complete information about a specific action that occurred
within the SDK, providing debug information describing it.
The amount of information logged can be configured as part of the SDK configuration.
See [config.logs][30] .

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used conjunction with the [Calls][31]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][32] API.

### getDevices

## proxy

The 'proxy' namespace allows for a secondary mode for making calls: proxy mode.
When proxy mode is enabled, the SDK will redirect webRTC / media operations from the current machine to a remote machine using a channel.
This is an advanced feature that enables support for Calls in particular scenarios that would otherwise not support them.

### Channel

The Channel object that the Proxy module needs to be provided.

Type: [Object][4]

**Examples**

```javascript
// The channel the application uses for communicating with a remote endpoint.
const appChannel = ...

// The channel the application will provide to the Proxy module for use.
const channel = {
   send: function (data) {
     // Any encoding / wrapping needed for a Proxy message being sent
     //    over the channel.
     appChannel.sendMessage(data)
   },
   // The Proxy module will set this function.
   receive: undefined
}
appChannel.on('message', data => {
   // Any decoding / unwrapping needed for the received message.
   channel.receive(data)
})

client.proxy.setChannel(channel)
```

#### receive

API that the Proxy module will assign a listener function for accepting received messages.
This function should receive all messages sent from the remote side of the channel.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **[Object][4]** The message received from the Channel.

#### send

Channel function that the Proxy module will use to send messages to the remote side.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **[Object][4]** Message to be sent over the channel.

### setProxyMode

Sets the mode for the Proxy Plugin.
When enabled, webRTC operations will be proxied over a channel. Enabling
   proxy mode requires a channel to have been set. See `setChannel` API.
When disabled, webRTC operation will occur as normal on the local machine.

**Parameters**

-   `value` **[boolean][7]** Whether proxy mode should be enabled.

### getProxyMode

Retrieves the current mode of the Proxy Plugin.

Returns **[boolean][7]** Whether proxy mode is currently enabled.

### getProxyDetails

Retrieve information about the proxy's browser being used.
Browser information being defined indicates that the browser supports
   basic webRTC scenarios.

**Examples**

```javascript
const details = client.proxy.getProxyDetails()

log(`Proxy Browser in use: ${details.browser}, version ${details.version}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][4]** Object containing `browser` and `version` information.

### setChannel

Sets the channel to be used while proxy mode is enabled.

**Parameters**

-   `channel` **Channel** See the `Channel` module for information.

### initializeRemote

Sends an initialization message over the channel with webRTC configurations.

**Parameters**

-   `config` **[Object][4]** 

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][46]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios. They can be provided during SDK instantiation
to be used for all calls.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][9]&lt;[string][5]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **SdpHandlerFunction** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.
