### MediaConstraint

The MediaConstraint type defines the format for configuring media options.
Either the `exact` or `ideal` property should be provided. If both are present, the
   `exact` value will be used.

When the `exact` value is provided, it will be the only value considered for the option.
   If it cannot be used, the constraint will be considered an error.

### CustomParameter

Custom SIP headers can be used to convey additional information to a SIP endpoint.

These parameters must be configured on the server prior to making a request, otherwise the request will fail when trying to include the parameters.

These parameters can be specified with the [call.make][36] and [call.answer][37] APIs.
They can also be set after a Call is established using the [call.setCustomParameters][38] API, and sent using the [call.sendCustomParameters][39] API.

Custom headers may be received anytime throughout the duration a call. A remote endpoint may send custom headers when starting a call,
 answering a call, or during call updates such as hold/unhold and addition/removal of media in the call.
 When these custom headers are received, the SDK will emit a [call:customParameters][40] event
 which will contain the custom parameters that were received.

A Call's custom parameters are stored on the Call's [CallObject][41],
 which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
 [call.getAll][24] APIs. These are the parameters that will be sent to the remote
 endpoint of the Call. Parameters received from a Call are not stored as
 part of the CallObject and are only provided via the [call:customParameters][40] event.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the custom parameter
-   `value` **[string][8]** The value of the custom parameter

**Examples**

```javascript
// Specify custom parameters when making a call.
client.call.make(destination, mediaConstraints,
 {
   customParameters: [
     {
       name: 'X-GPS',
       value: '42.686032,23.344565'
     }
   ]
 }
)
```

### make

Starts an outgoing call to a [SIP_URI][42] or a
   [TEL_URI][43].

The call will be tracked by a unique ID that is returned by the API. The
   application will use this ID to identify and control the call after it
   has been initiated.

The [call.getById][25] API can be used to retrieve
   the current information about the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][45] event
   locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
   receives the call, a [call:receive][46]
   event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

**Parameters**

-   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][47] \| [call.TEL_URI][48])** The desired destination.
-   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options the call should be initialized with.
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether the call should have audio on start. Currently, audio-less calls are not supported. (optional, default `false`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// Listen for the event emitted after making a call.
client.on('call:start', function (params) {
  const { callId, error } = params
  if (error) {
    // Call failed to initialize.
  } else {
    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

Returns **[string][8]** The generated ID of the newly created call.

### reject

Rejects an incoming call.

The specified call to reject must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][51] event, that the
   call was rejected.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to reject.

### answer

Answers an incoming call.

The specified call to answer must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will become connected as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. This indicates that the
   call has connected with the remote participant. The
   [call.getById][25] API can be used to retrieve the latest call state
   after the change. Further events will be emitted to indicate that the
   call has received media from the remote participant. See the
   [call:newTrack][52] event for more
   information about this.

The SDK requires access to the system's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to answer a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

### sendRingingFeedback

Sends the "ringing feedback" notification to the remote participant of a call.

When using the 'manual' `ringingFeedbackMode` configuration, the application
   is responsible for transitioning the call into the `Ringing` state. This
   API will notify both ends of the call to enter `Ringing` state at the same
   time. The application may decide not to send the "ringing feedback"
   notification by not using this API. The `ringingFeedbackMode` configuration
   must be set to 'manual' to use this API.

The specified call must be an incoming call in `Initiated` state. The call
   will enter `Ringing` state as a result of the operation.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant will
   be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][51] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.

### ignore

Ignores an incoming call.

The specified call to ignore must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will not be notified that the call was ignored.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to ignore.

### hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
   media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
   and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
   being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
   call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][53] API.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][51] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to hold.

### unhold

Takes a call off hold.

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
   also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
   the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][51] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to unhold.

### setCustomParameters

Set the [Custom Parameters][54] of a Call, to be provided to the remote endpoint.

The specified parameters will be saved as part of the call's information throughout the duration of the call.
All subsequent call operations will include these custom parameters.
Therefore, invalid parameters, or parameters not previously configured on the server, will cause subsequent call operations to fail.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][41],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

The custom parameters set on a call can be sent directly with the [call.sendCustomParameters][39] API.

Custom parameters can be removed from a call's information by setting them as undefined (e.g., `call.setCustomParameters(callId)`).
Subsequent call operations will no longer send custom parameters.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][14]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][30]>** The custom parameters to set.

### sendCustomParameters

Send the custom parameters on an ongoing call to the server. The server may either consume the headers or relay them
to another endpoint, depending on how the server is configured.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][41],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

To change or remove the custom parameters on a call, use the [call.setCustomParameters][38] API.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call being acted on.

### getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

**Examples**

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][14]&lt;[call.CallObject][55]>** Call objects.

### getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **[call.CallObject][55]** A call object.

### end

Ends an ongoing call.

The SDK will stop any/all local media associated with the call. Events
   will be emitted to indicate which media tracks were stopped. See the
   [call:trackEnded][56] event for more
   information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][51] event, that the
   call was ended.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to end.

### addMedia

Add new media tracks to an ongoing call.
Will get new media tracks from the specific sources to add to the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][52] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

   participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call does not
   already have video. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.addMedia][57] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

    -   `options.dscpControls` **[call.DSCPControls][50]?** Options for configuring DSCP markings on the media traffic.

### stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
   to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
   video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.removeMedia][58] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][56]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.

### startScreenshare

Adds local screenshare to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.addMedia][57] API can be used to perform the same behaviour
   as `startScreenshare`. [call.addMedia][57] is a general-purpose API
   for adding media to a call, which covers the same functionality as
   `startScreenshare`. Selecting only screen options when using
   [call.addMedia][57] will perform the same behaviour as using
   `startScreenshare`.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Select media options for adding only screenshare.
const media = {
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   screenOptions: { ... }
}

// Add the selected media to the call.
client.call.addMedia(callId, media)
```

### stopScreenshare

Removes local screenshare from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being
   sent to the remote participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.removeMedia][58] API can be used to perform the same
   behaviour as `stopScreenshare`. [call.removeMedia][58] is a
   general-purpose API for removing media from a call, which covers the
   same functionality as `stopScreenshare`. Specifying only the screen
   track when using [call.removeMedia][58] will perform the same
   behaviour as using `stopScreenshare`.

There is a caveat that if a Call has multiple video tracks (for example,
   both a video and a screen track), the SDK itself cannot yet
   differentiate one from the other. The application will need to know
   which track was the screen track in this scenario.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of any/all video tracks on the call.
const videoTracks = call.localTracks.filter(trackId => {
   const track = call.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   // Both video and screen tracks have kind of 'video'.
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Pick out the screen track.
const screenTrack = videoTracks[0]

// Remove screen from the call.
client.call.removeMedia(callId, [ screenTrack ])
```

### sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
   state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `tone` **[string][8]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','*' and ','].
-   `duration` **[number][12]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
-   `intertoneGap` **[number][12]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

### getStats

Retrieve a snapshot of the low-level information of the Call through statistical
   report.

The data retrieved is a [RTCStatsReport][59]
   object, which contains many individual
   [RTCStats][60].
   These are advanced statistics gathered by the browser providing insights
   into the Call at a certain point in time. Aggregating reports over a
   period of time would allow a low-level analysis of the Call for that
   period. As an example, this could be done to determine the media quality
   during the Call.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific
   Track of the Call.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, will contain the report of the particlar call.
The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:statsReceived][61] event, after
   the operation completes, that has the report.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
-   `trackId` **[string][8]?** ID of a Track being used by the Call. If not
       provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

**Examples**

```javascript
client.on('call:statsReceived', function (params) {
   // Iterate over each individual statistic inside the RTCPStatsReport.
   params.result.forEach(stats => {
       // Handle the data on its own or collate with previously gathered stats
       //    for analysis.
       ...
   })
})

// Get a snapshot of the Call's stats.
//   This may be done on a regular interval to collect data over time.
client.call.getStats(callId)
```

### forward

Forwards an incoming call to another user.

The specified destination will receive the Call instead of the current
   user.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][51]
   event after the operation completes.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][47] \| [call.TEL_URI][48])** The destination to forward the call to.

### consultativeTransfer

Performs a "consultative" transfer between two ongoing calls (also known
   as an announced or warm transfer). This allows the current user to
   transfer the remote participant of a call to another user, after
   having spoken to both users.

Both calls used for the transfer must be locally held. After the
   operation, these calls will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][51] event.

Both remote participants will see their call be unheld by the operation,
   as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][51] event, and will
   be connected to one another afterwards.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event. Both local
   calls will receive this event, since it is an operation on both calls,
   and the remote calls will receive it as if it were a "remote unhold"
   operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][8]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### directTransfer

Performs a "direct" transfer on a call (also known as an unannounced or
   blind transfer). This allows the current user to transfer the remote
   participant of a call to another user, similar to a "forward"
   operation.

The specified call must be locally held. After the operation, this call
   will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][51] event.

The "destination" user will receive an incoming call, and when answered,
   they will be connected with the remote participant of the specified
   call.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event. The remote
   participant being transferred will receive it as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][47] \| [call.TEL_URI][48])** The destination to transfer the call to.

### join

Performs a "join" on two ongoing calls.
This allows the current user to establish a call with audio with two
   remote users.

Both specified calls must be locally held. The new, "joined" call will be
   audio-only, even if either previous call had video. Video cannot be
   added to the "joined" call. Both remote participants will see their
   call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
   participants after the operation. Both previous calls for the current
   user will be ended after the operation, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][51] event.

If the first call specified has custom parameters set, these parameters will be carried over to the new call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event. Both remote
   participants will also receive this event as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][8]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][62] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][49]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][49]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[call.MediaConstraint][49]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[call.MediaConstraint][49]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[call.MediaConstraint][49]?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Can also replace the specified video track of the call with a new
// screen sharing track because screen sharing is delivered as a video stream to remote peer.
// User will then be prompted to pick a specific screen to share and thus the device id will be selected.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a screen sharing track.
  // Note that 'screenOptions' property is not mandatory, as API will use default values
  // for properties like: width, height, frameRate.
  screen: true
})
```

### getAvailableCodecs

Retrieve the list of available and supported codecs based on the browser's capabilities for sending media.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, it will contain the list of available and supported codecs.
In addition, the SDK emits a [call:availableCodecs][63] event
 upon retrieving that list of codecs.

This API is a wrapper for the static method [RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities()][64].
 Firefox browser does not currently support this method. Therefore, this API will not work on Firefox.

**Parameters**

-   `kind` **[string][8]** The kind of media, i.e., 'audio' or 'video', to get the list of available codecs of.

### setSdpHandlers

Set [SDP Handler Functions][65] that will be run as part of a pipeline for all future calls.
 This will replace any SDP Handlers that were previously set.

SDP handlers can be used to make modifications to the SDP (e.g., removing certain codecs)
 before they are processed or sent to the other side.

This is an advanced feature, changing the SDP handlers mid-call may cause
 unexpected behaviour in future call operations for that call.

**Parameters**

-   `sdpHandlers` **[Array][14]&lt;[call.SdpHandlerFunction][18]>** The list of SDP handler functions to modify SDP.

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.
Unless stated otherwise, the Call's state pertains to both caller & callee.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][41],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][51]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call is being started. While in this state, no Call operations can be performed until Call gets into Initiated state.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
-   `RINGING` **[string][8]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][8]** The call has not been answered, but media
       is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
       system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
       supported, this state may replace the Ringing state. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][8]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered. This is a state valid only for callee's side.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][8]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

### mediaConnectionStates

Possible states that a Call's media connection can be in.

A Call's media connection state describes the current status of media within the call.
 An application should use this state to understand whether the Call participants are
 able to see/hear each other or may be experiencing connection issues. The media connection
 state can be used alongside the [Call state][27] to determine if media issues
 are occurring while the participants are expecting to be connected.

An important state to check for is the `FAILED` state. This state signifies that there is no
   media connection between the call participants and an action must be taken to resolve the
   problem. Using the [call.restartMedia][66] API will attempt to reconnect the media. See
   the [call.restartMedia][66] API description for more information.

These states are direct reflections of the possible
 [RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState][67] values.

The Call's media connection state is a property of the [CallObject][41],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][25] or
   [call.getAll][24] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:mediaConnectionChange][68]
   event when a Call's media connection state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `NEW` **[string][8]** The Call is initializing the local side of the connection and waiting on information from the remote side.
     When the information is received, the state will transition into `checking` as the Call automatically begins the connection process.
-   `CHECKING` **[string][8]** The Call has received information from the remote endpoint and is working to establish the media connection.
     When finished, the state will transition to either `connected` or `failed`.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** A usable connection has been made and the Call will now have media.
     The connection may not be optimal, though, so the Call will continue establishment to improve the connection before going into the `completed` state.
-   `COMPLETED` **[string][8]** The media connection process has fully completed and the optimal connection has been established. While in this state,
     the Call endpoints will receive each other's media.
-   `DISCONNECTED` **[string][8]** Media has become disconnected and the Call endpoints have stopped receiving each other's media.
     The Call will automatically attempt to reconnect, transitioning back to `completed` if successful or to `failed` if not.
-   `FAILED` **[string][8]** The connection has failed and cannot be recovered automatically. A full media connection refresh is required to restablish a connection. See the [call.restartMedia][66] API.
-   `CLOSED` **[string][8]** The connection has been shut down and is no longer in use.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the media connection states to check the status of the media connection of the Call.
client.on('call:mediaConnectionChange', function (params) {
  // Retrieve the state of the Call this event is for.
  const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
  const mediaConnectionStates = client.call.mediaConnectionStates

  // Check the mediaConnectionState to determine which scenario the call is in.
  switch (call.mediaConnectionState) {
    case mediaConnectionStates.CONNECTED:
    case mediaConnectionStates.COMPLETED:
      // Media established: The Call's media is connected. The Call's participants
      //    are able to see/hear each other.
      // These states will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.NEW:
    case mediaConnectionStates.CHECKING:
    case mediaConnectionStates.DISCONNECTED:
      // Media pending: The Call's media is not connected. The Call is working
      //    to connect media automatically.
      // These states will occur during Call establishment and may occur midcall if there are
      //    connection issues (eg. poor network quality) or a Call participant has changed (eg. transfer).
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.FAILED:
     // Media has failed. The call requires a media refresh to restablish.
     // This state will occur after the `DISCONNECTED` state is encountered.
     ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.CLOSED:
      // Media ended due to the Call being ended.
      // This state will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
  }
}
```

### restartMedia

Attempt to re-establish a media connection for a call.

This API will perform a "refresh" operation on the call with the intention
   of resolving media issues that may have been encountered. This API is only
   necessary after the Call's [mediaConnectionState][28]
   has entered the `failed` state, but may be used in other scenarios.

After the operation completes successfully, the Call will be re-establishing
   its media connection. By this time, or shortly after, the Call's
   [mediaConnectionState][28] should have
   transitioned to `checking` (via a
   [call:mediaConnectionChange][68]
   event) to signify the re-establishment. It will then transition to either
   `connected` or `failed` state, similar to during the initial Call establishment.

If this operation fails, then the Call will not attempt the re-establishment
   and will remain in the `failed` [mediaConnectionState][28].

Behaviour during the operation may differ slightly based on the browser.
   Notably, Firefox will always transition to the `checking`
   [mediaConnectionState][28] no matter what
   the previous state was. Whereas Chrome will skip the `checking` state,
   transitioning directly to either `connected` or `failed`. This has the
   implication for Chrome that if the state does not change (for example,
   the Call is in the `failed` state before the media restart operation,
   and media re-establishment fails), then there will be no
   [call:mediaConnectionChange][68]
   event emitted. For this reason, Chrome-based applications may need a
   short delay after receiving the [call:mediaRestart][69]
   event before checking the Call's updated
   [mediaConnectionState][28] to ensure the
   application is acting on the "latest" state.

The SDK will emit a [call:mediaRestart][69]
   event when the operation completes.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][44] event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to act on.

### setDefaultDevices

The `setDefaultDevices` API from previous SDK releases (3.X) has been
   deprecated in the latest releases (4.X+). The SDK no longer keeps
   track of "default devices" on behalf of the application.

The devices used for a call can be selected as part of the APIs for
   starting the call. Microphone and/or camera can be chosen in the
   [call.make][36] and [call.answer][37] APIs, and speaker can be
   chosen when the audio track is rendered with the
   [media.renderTracks][70] API.

### changeInputDevices

Changes the camera and/or microphone used for a Call's media input.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeInputDevices` API can be implemented
   using the general-purpose [call.replaceTrack][71] API. This API can
   be used to replace an existing media track with a new track of the
   same type, allowing an application to change certain aspects of the
   media, such as input device.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's video track.
const videoTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Select the new video options.
const media = {
   video: true,
   videoOptions: {
       deviceId: 'cameraId'
   }
}

// Change the call's camera by replacing the video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack, media)
```

### changeSpeaker

Changes the speaker used for a Call's audio output. Supported on
   browser's that support HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId().

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeSpeaker` API can be implemented by
   re-rendering the Call's audio track.  A speaker can be selected when
   rendering an audio track, so changing a speaker can be simulated
   by unrendering the track with [media.removeTracks][72], then
   re-rendering it with a new speaker with [media.renderTracks][70].

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's audio track.
const audioTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'audio'
})

// Where the audio track was previously rendered.
const audioContainer = ...

// Unrender the audio track we want to change speaker for.
client.media.removeTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer)
// Re-render the audio track with a new speaker.
client.media.renderTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer, {
   speakerId: 'speakerId'
})
```

### SIP_URI

Type: [string][8]

### TEL_URI

The TEL URI ie: tel:+18885559876

## callHistory

The 'call.history' namespace is used to retrieve and inspect the authenticated
users call logs.

Functions below are all part of this namespace.

### fetch

`callHistory:changed` is used to indicate the local state of logs
has been updated.

**Examples**

```javascript
client.on('callHistory:change', function() {
    // Get all call logs when they've been updated.
    let callLogs = client.call.history.get();
});
```

Returns **[Array][14]** A list of call log records, ordered by latest first.

### getCache

Gets the cached call history data and returns stringified data.

The data is provided in a format that can be used directly with the
   [call.history.setCache][74] API. This allows an
   application to persist the information across SDK instances when the
   backend environment does not support the CallHistory feature.

Returns **[string][8]** A stringified list of call log records from the cache, ordered by latest first.

### setCache

Sets the cached call history data, expects stringified data as it will be parsed.

The data can be retreived from the [   call.history.getCache][75] API. This allows an
   application to persist the information across SDK instances when the
   backend environment does not support the CallHistory feature.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **[string][8]** The stringified call history data to store in the cache.

## clickToCall

### Message

A Message object is a means by which a sender can deliver information to a recipient.

Creating and sending a message:

A message object can be obtained through the [Conversation.createMessage][79] API on an existing conversation.

Messages have Parts which represent pieces of a message, such as a text part, a json object part or a file part.
Once all the desired parts have been added to the message using the [Message.addPart][81] function,
the message can then be sent using the [Message.send][82] function.

Once the sender sends a message, this message is saved in sender's state as an object.
Similarly, once the recipient gets a message, this message is saved in recipient's state.

Retrieving a delivered message:

Once a message is delivered successfully, it can be
obtained through the [Conversation.getMessages][83] or [Conversation.getMessage][84] API on an existing conversation.

Below are the properties pertaining to the message object, returned by Conversation.getMessage(s) APIs, for either sender or recipient.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][12]** A Unix timestamp in seconds marking the time when the message was created by sender.
-   `parts` **[Array][14]&lt;conversation.Part>** An array of Part Objects.
-   `sender` **[string][8]** The primary contact address of the sender.
-   `destination` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** An array of primary contact addresses associated with various destinations to which the message is meant to be delivered.
-   `messageId` **[string][8]** The unique id of the message. The message object (stored in sender's state) has a different id
    than the one associated with the message object stored in recipient's state.
-   `type` **[string][8]** The type of message that was sent. See [conversation.chatTypes][85] for valid types.
    This property applies only to message objects stored in sender's state.

#### send

Sends the message.

## logger

The SDK has an internal logging system for providing information about its
   behaviour. The SDK will generate logs, at different levels for different
   types of information, which are routed to a
   "[Log Handler][4]" for consumption. An application
   can provide their own Log Handler (see
   [config.logs][86]) to customize how the logs are
   handled, or allow the default Log Handler to print the logs to the
   console.

The SDK's default Log Handler is merely a thin wrapper around the browser's
   console API (ie. `window.console`). It receives the log generated by the
   SDK, called a "[Log Entry][5]", formats a
   human-readable message with it, then uses the console to log it at the
   appropriate level. This is important to be aware of, since your browser's
   console may affect how you see the SDK's default log messages. Since the
   default Log Handler uses the console's levels, the browser may filter
   which messages are shown depending on which levels it has configured. For
   a user that understands console log levels, this can be helpful for
   filtering the logs to only the relevant information. But it can equally
   be a hindrance by hiding the more detailed log messages (at the 'debug'
   level), since browser can have this level hidden by default. For this
   reason, we recommend providing a custom Log Handler to the SDK that is
   better suited for your application and its users.

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

The SDK will provide [Log Entries][5] to the
   [Log Handler][4] for all logs at or above the set
   log level. 'debug' is considered the lowest level and 'silent' the
   highest level. For example, if the current level is 'info', then the
   [Log Handler][4] will receive
   [Log Entries][5] for logs at 'info', 'warn', and
   'error', but not for the 'debug' level.

**Properties**

-   `SILENT` **[string][8]** Nothing will be logged.
-   `ERROR` **[string][8]** Unhandled error information will be logged. If
       the SDK encounters an issue it cannot resolve, the error will be included
       in the logs. This likely points to an issue with the SDK itself or an
       issue with how the SDK is being used.
-   `WARN` **[string][8]** Warning messages for the application developer will
       be logged. If the SDK encounters an issue that it can recover and continue,
       a warning about the issue will be included in the logs. These logs point
       to issues that need to be handled by the application. For example, providing
       an invalid configuration to the SDK will cause a warning log that explains
       the issue.
-   `INFO` **[string][8]** General information about the SDK's operations will
       be logged, outlining how the SDK is handling the operations. Reading through
       these logs should provide a high-level view of what the SDK is doing,
       and why it is doing it.
-   `DEBUG` **[string][8]** Detailed information about the SDK's operations,
       meant for debugging issues, will be logged. Specific information and relevant
       operation data are provided for understanding the scenario that the SDK
       was in during the operation.

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
   logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
   and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
   [config.logs][86]) will need to handle LogEntry
   objects.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][12]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
-   `method` **[string][8]** The log function that was used to create the log.
-   `level` **[string][8]** The level of severity the log.
-   `target` **[Object][7]** The subject that the log is about.
    -   `target.type` **[string][8]** The type of the target. This is also
           used as part of the name of the Logger.
    -   `target.id` **[string][8]?** A unique identifer for the target.
    -   `target.name` **[string][8]** A combination of the target type and ID. If no
           id was provided, this will be the same as the type.
-   `messages` **[Array][14]** The logged information, given to the Logger
       method as parameters.
-   `timer` **[Object][7]?** Timing data, if the log method was a timer method.

**Examples**

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
   default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
   be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
   [config.logs][86]). The SDK will then provide this
   function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][17]

**Parameters**

-   `LogEntry` **[Object][7]** The LogEntry to be logged.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][87]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][88] API.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][89] event will be
   emitted when the available media devices have changed.

Returns **[Object][7]** The lists of camera, microphone, and speaker devices.

### getById

Retrieves an available Media object with a specific Media ID.

**Parameters**

-   `mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Media to retrieve.

Returns **[call.MediaObject][90]** A Media object.

### getTrackById

Retrieve an available Track object with a specific Track ID.

**Parameters**

-   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Track to retrieve.

Returns **[call.TrackObject][34]** A Track object.

### initializeDevices

Requests permission to access media devices on the end-user's machine.

This API will trigger the browser to ask the end-user for permission to
   access their camera and/or microphone. These permissions are
   needed for the SDK to read information about the devices (the label,
   for example) and for using the devices for a call.

If the browser does not yet have permission, it will prompt the end-user
   with a small pop-up window, giving the user a chance to allow/deny the
   permissions. The behaviour of this pop-up window differs slightly
   based on the browser; it may automatically save the user's decision
   (such as in Chrome and Safari) or it may require the user to choose
   whether their decision should be saved (such as in Firefox).

This API is not required for proper usage of media and/or calls, but
   helps to prepare a user before a call is made or received. It allows
   an application to prompt the user for device permissions when it is
   convenient for them, rather than during call setup. If the user saves
   their decision, they will not be prompted again when the SDK accesses
   those devices for a call.

For device information, the [media.getDevices][88] API will retrieve
   the list of media devices available for the SDK to use. If this list
   is empty, or is missing information, it is likely that the browser
   does not have permission to access the device's information. We
   recommend using the [media.initializeDevices][91] API in this
   scenario if you would like to allow the end-user to select which
   device(s) they would like to use when they make a call, rather than
   using the system default.

The SDK will emit a [devices:change][89]
   event when the operation is successful or a
   [devices:error][92] event if an error is
   encountered.

**Parameters**

-   `constraints` **[Object][7]?** 
    -   `constraints.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for audio device permissions. (optional, default `true`)
    -   `constraints.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for video device permissions. (optional, default `true`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// The SDK will ask for both audio and video permissions by default.
client.media.initializeDevices()

// The SDK will only ask for audio permissions.
client.media.initializeDevices({ audio: true, video: false })
```

### renderTracks

Render Media Tracks in a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.
-   `options` **[Object][7]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.
    -   `options.speakerId` **[string][8]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

**Examples**

```javascript
// When a Call receives a new track, render it.
client.on('call:newTrack', function (params) {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(params.trackId)
   const container = params.local ? localContainer : remoteContainer

   // Render the Call's new track when it first becomes available.
   client.media.renderTracks([ track.trackId ], container)
})
```

### removeTracks

Remove Media Tracks from a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to stop being rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks at their media source.

Prevents media from being received for the Tracks. Audio Tracks will
   become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
   noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
   call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][93] event
   when a Track has been muted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume as normal for the Tracks.

-   `user` **([Array][14]&lt;[string][8]> | [string][8])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

### subscribe

Subscribe to another User's presence updates.

When the User updates their presence information, the SDK will emit a
   [presence:change][105] event.

**Parameters**

-   `users` **([Array][14]&lt;[string][8]> | [string][8])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

### unsubscribe

Unsubscribe from another User's presence updates.

**Parameters**

-   `users` **([Array][14]&lt;[string][8]> | [string][8])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

## proxy

The 'proxy' namespace allows for a secondary mode for making calls: proxy mode.
When proxy mode is enabled, the SDK will redirect webRTC / media operations from the current machine to a remote machine using a channel.
This is an advanced feature that enables support for Calls in particular scenarios that would otherwise not support them.

### Channel

The Channel object that the Proxy module needs to be provided.

Type: [Object][7]

**Examples**

```javascript
// The channel the application uses for communicating with a remote endpoint.
const appChannel = ...

// The channel the application will provide to the Proxy module for use.
const channel = {
   send: function (data) {
     // Any encoding / wrapping needed for a Proxy message being sent
     //    over the channel.
     appChannel.sendMessage(data)
   },
   // The Proxy module will set this function.
   receive: undefined
}
appChannel.on('message', data => {
   // Any decoding / unwrapping needed for the received message.
   channel.receive(data)
})

client.proxy.setChannel(channel)
```

#### send

Channel function that the Proxy module will use to send messages to the remote side.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **[Object][7]** Message to be sent over the channel.

#### receive

API that the Proxy module will assign a listener function for accepting received messages.
This function should receive all messages sent from the remote side of the channel.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **[Object][7]** The message received from the Channel.

### setProxyMode

Sets the mode for the Proxy Plugin.
When enabled, webRTC operations will be proxied over a channel. Enabling
   proxy mode requires a channel to have been set. See `setChannel` API.
When disabled, webRTC operation will occur as normal on the local machine.

**Parameters**

-   `value` **[boolean][11]** Whether proxy mode should be enabled.

### getProxyMode

Retrieves the current mode of the Proxy Plugin.

Returns **[boolean][11]** Whether proxy mode is currently enabled.

### getInfo

Retrieve information about the proxy.

**Examples**

```javascript
const proxy = client.proxy.getInfo()

log(`Proxy Browser in use: ${proxy.browser}, mode: ${proxy.proxyMode}, channel: ${proxy.hasChannel}, initialized: ${proxy.remoteInitialized}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** [proxy] Object containing information about the proxy.

Returns **[boolean][11]** [proxy.proxyMode] Current operating mode.

Returns **[boolean][11]** [proxy.hasChannel] Proxy has a channel associated with it.

Returns **[boolean][11]** [proxy.remoteInitialized] Proxy initialization state.

Returns **[Object][7]** [proxy.browser] Details for the browser the proxy is using.

### getProxyDetails

Retrieve information about the proxy's browser being used.
Browser information being defined indicates that the browser supports
   basic webRTC scenarios.

**Examples**

```javascript
const details = client.proxy.getProxyDetails()

log(`Proxy Browser in use: ${details.browser}, version ${details.version}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** Object containing `browser` and `version` information.

### setChannel

Sets the channel to be used while proxy mode is enabled.

**Parameters**

-   `channel` **[proxy.Channel][107]** See the `Channel` module for information.

### initializeRemote

Sends an initialization message over the channel with webRTC configurations.

The version of the SDK and the Remote SDK must be the same, otherwise
   initialization will fail.

**Parameters**

-   `config` **[Object][7]** 

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][65]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios.

Note that SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They can be added during
initialization of the SDK using the [config.call.sdpHandlers][108] configuration
parameter. They can also be set after the SDK's creation by using the
[call.setSdpHandlers][109] function.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

```javascript
// Through the Call API post-instantiation
client.call.setSdpHandlers([ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...])
```

### CodecSelector

An object that represents a selector to match codecs of an RTP map in SDP.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the codec.
-   `fmtpParams` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** An array of strings to match against the "a=fmtp" format parameters for the corresponding codec.
                                         All of the elements in the array must be contained in the "a=fmtp" attribute in order to be a match.

### createCodecRemover

This function creates an SDP handler that will remove codecs matching the selectors specified for SDP offers and answers.

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to remote parties. For example, some legacy call services limit the SDP
length (usually to 4KB) and will reject calls that have SDP size above this amount.

While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the createCodecRemover function creates a codec removal handler that can be used for this purpose. Applications can use this codec
removal handler in combination with the [call.getAvailableCodecs][110] function in order to build logic to determine the best codecs to use
for their application.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **([Array][14]&lt;CodecSelector> | [Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>)** A list of codec selectors to remove from the SDP. If passing a list of strings, they will be converted into
                                                         codec selectors that correspond to those names without any extra FMTP parameters.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';

const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover([
  // Remove all VP8 and VP9 codecs.
  'VP8',
  'VP9',

  // Remove all H264 codecs with the specified FMTP parameters.
  {
    name: 'H264',
    fmtpParams: ['profile-level-id=4d0032', 'packetization-mode=1']
  }
])

const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[call.SdpHandlerFunction][18]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## services

The 'services' namespace allows an application to manage how they wish the SDK to
   receive communications from the platform. An application can subscribe to
   services in order to receive updates about that service for the current
   user. A feature generally requires a subscription for its service to be
   fully functional.

The services an application can subscribe to are based on the features
   included in the SDK. The list of available services can be retrieved
   using the [services.getSubscriptions][111] API. These values can be used
   with the [services.subscribe][15] API.

The channel used for subscriptions is the method for receiving the service
   updates. The recommended channel is `websocket`, where the SDK is able to
   handle receiving the updates internally. Alternate channel methods, if a
   websocket cannot be used, will be available in the future.

### ServiceDescriptor

The ServiceDescriptor type defines the format for specifying how to subscribe for a certain service.
This is the service configuration object that needs to be passed (as part of an array of configuration objects) when calling
the [services.subscribe][15] function.
Only some plugins (`call`, `messaging` and `presence`) support such configuration object that needs to be passed
to the subscribe function.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `service` **[string][8]** The name of the available service user wants to subscribe to.
    The available service names are `chat`, `presence`, `call` and `smsinbound`.
-   `params` **[Object][7]?** An object containing any additional parameters required for subscribing to that service.
    This is an optional property as not all service subscriptions require it.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe to chat, presence & call services on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'chat'},
   {service: 'presence'},
   {service: 'call'},
], 'websocket')
```

### SmsInboundServiceParams

The SmsInboundServiceParams type defines the additional information when subscribing to SMS inbound service.
This is the configuration object that needs to be passed as the value for the [ServiceDescriptor.params][112] property.

Type: [Object][7]

**Properties**

-   `destinationAddress` **[string][8]** An E164 formatted DID number.
        The subscription created will provide notifications for inbound SMS messages destined for this address.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe to smsinbound service on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'smsinbound', params: {destinationAddress: '+18001234567'}}
], 'websocket')
```

### subscribe

Subscribes to platform notifications for an SDK service.

Extra configuration can be provide as an additional object parameter.
Currently only a "forceLogOut" flag can be supplied in this object.

For push notifications on link, please see [notifications.registerPush][113]

The SDK currently only supports the `websocket` channel as a subscription
   type.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][14]&lt;([string][8] \| [services.ServiceDescriptor][114])>** A list of service configurations.
-   `options` **[Object][7]?** The options object for non-credential options.
    -   `options.forceLogOut` **[boolean][11]?** Force the oldest connection to log out if too many simultaneous connections. Link only.
    -   `options.type` **[string][8]** The method of how to receive service updates. (optional, default `'websocket'`)
    -   `options.clientCorrelator` **[string][8]?** Unique ID for the client. This is used by the platform to identify an instance of the application used by the specific device.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe for chat and SMS services.
client.services.subscribe(['call', 'IM'], {forceLogOut: true, clientCorrelator: 'abc123'})
```

### unsubscribe

Cancels existing subscriptions for platform notifications.

Existing subscriptions can be retrieved using the
   [services.getSubscriptions][111] API. The `subscribed` values are the
   services that can be unsubscribed from.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** A list of subscribed service names.
-   `type` **[string][8]** The method of how the service updates
       are being received. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// Unsubscribe from chat and SMS services.
const services = [ 'chat', 'smsinbound' ]

client.services.unsubscribe(services)
```

### getSubscriptions

Retrieves information about currently subscribed services and available services.

The `available` values are the SDK's services that an application can
   subscribe to receive notifications about. A feature generally
   requires a subscription to its service in order to be fully functional.

The `subscribed` values are the SDK's services that the application has
   an active subscription for. Services are subscribed to using the
   [services.subscribe][15] API.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Get the lists of services.
const services = client.services.getSubscriptions()

// Figure out which available services don't have a subscription.
const notSubscribed = services.available.filter(service => {
   return !services.subscribed.includes(service)
})

// Subscribe for all not-yet-subscribed services.
client.services.subscribe(notSubscribed)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** Lists of subscribed and available services.

## sip

The SIP Events feature allows an application to communicate with a SIP network integrated
     with their Kandy Link instance. The SIP network may generate custom events intended
     for an application, which can be handled with the SDK's `sip` namespace.

Usage of SIP Events is dependent on your Kandy Link instance. The types of SIP Events can
   be different based on configurations and components, often being part of a custom
   solution. As such, the SIP Events feature is presented in a generic manner to be
   flexible for any possible events.

An example of a common SIP event is "SIP presence". When a user is connected to a SIP phone,
   the network may generate "phone presence" events when the user starts and ends a call
   (eg. 'On Call', 'Available'). Applications can subscribe to receive these events for
   specific users.

A SIP event may either be solicited or unsolicited. Solicited events, such as the "presence"
   example above, requires the application to subscribe for the event. See the
   [sip.subscribe API][115] for more information about solicited events.
   Unsolicited events have no prerequisites for being received.

### subscribe

Creates a subscription for a SIP event.

A subscription is required to receive SIP notifications for solicited events. Before
   creating a SIP subscription, the service for the event type must have been
   provisioned as part of the user subscription using the [services.subscribe][15]
   API.

Only one SIP subscription per event type can exist at a time. A subscription can
   watch for events from multiple users at once. Users can be added to or removed
   from a subscription using the [sip.update][116] API at any time.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][117]
   event when the operations completes. The [sip.getDetails][118] API can be used
   to retrieve the current information about a subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:eventsChange][119] event when
   a SIP event is received.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.
-   `subscribeUserList` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** The list of users to receive events about.
-   `clientCorrelator` **[string][8]** Unique identifier for a client device.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][14]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][30]>?** Custom SIP header parameters for the SIP backend.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Provision the service for the specific SIP event during user subscription.
//   This is required before a SIP subscription for the event can be created.
const services = ['call', 'event:presence', ...]
client.services.subscribe(services)

// Subscribe to receive SIP presence events from two users.
client.sip.subscribe('event:presence', ['userOne@example.com', 'userTwo@example.com'], 'clientId123')

// Subscribe for SIP events with a custom parameter.
const customParameters = [{
   name: 'X-nt-GUID',
   value: 'GUID123abc'
}]
client.sip.subscribe('event:presence', subscribeUserList, 'clientId123', customParameters)
```

### update

Updates an existing SIP event subscription.

Allows for adding or removing users from the subscription, and for changing the
   custom parameters of the subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][117]
   event when the operations completes. The [sip.getDetails][118] API can be used
   to retrieve the current information about a subscription.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.
-   `userLists` **[Object][7]** 
    -   `userLists.subscribeUserList` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** List of users to add to the subscription.
    -   `userLists.unsubscribeUserList` **[Array][14]&lt;[string][8]>** List of users to remove from the subscription. If all users are removed, the event subscription will be deleted.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][14]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][30]>?** Custom SIP header parameters for the SIP backend.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Add a user to an existing subscription.
const userLists = {
   subscribedUserList: ['userThree@example.com']
}
client.sip.update('event:presence', userLists)

// Simultaneously add and remove users from the subscription.
const userLists = {
   subscribedUserList: ['userThree@example.com'],
   unsubscribeUserList: ['userOne@example.com']
}
client.sip.update('event:presence', userLists)
```

### unsubscribe

Deletes an existing SIP event subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][117]
   event when the operations completes.

Subscription details will no longer be available using the [sip.getDetails][118]
   API after it has been unsubscribed from.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Delete a SIP subscription.
client.sip.unsubscribe('event:presence')
```

### getDetails

Retrieve information about a SIP event subscription.

The SDK will track which users are included as part of the subscription and
   previous notifications received. Each subscription will include a unique ID.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][8]?** The name of a SIP event. If not provided, will retrieve
       information for all SIP subscriptions.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Retrieve information about a single SIP subscription.
const { subscribedUsers, notifications } = client.sip.getDetails('event:presence')

// Retrieve information about all current SIP subscriptions.
const subscriptions = client.sip.getDetails()
const { subscribedUsers, notifications } = subscriptions['event:presence']
```

Returns **[Object][7]** SIP subscription information. If `eventType` was not provided, will
   return an object namespaced by event types.

## user

The 'user' namespace allows access to user information for users within the same domain.

### User

The SDK will emit a [users:change][120]
   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

Information about an available User can be retrieved using the
   [user.get][121] API.

**Parameters**

-   `userId` **[string][8]** The User ID of the user.

### fetchSelfInfo

Fetches information about the current User from directory.
Compared to [user.fetch][122] API, this API retrieves additional user related information.

   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

Information about an available User can be retrieved using the
   [user.get][121] API.

### get

Retrieves information about a User, if available.

See the [user.fetch][122] and [user.search][123] APIs for details about
   making Users' information available.

### search

Searches the domain's directory for Users.

Directory searching only supports one filter. If multiple filters are provided, only one of the filters will be used for the search.
A search with no filters provided will return all users.

The SDK will emit a [directory:change][125]
   event after the operation completes. The search results will be
   provided as part of the event, and will also be available using the
   [user.get][121] and [user.getAll][126] APIs.
