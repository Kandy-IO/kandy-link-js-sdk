## create

The SDK creation factory. Create an instance of the SDK by calling this factory with the desired configurations.
The SDK instance will be refered as 'api' throughout the rest of the documentation content.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[config][1]** The configuration object.

### Examples

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK.
import { create } from 'kandy'
const client = create({
    authentication: { ... },
    logs: { ... },
    ...
});
// Use the SDK's API.
client.on( ... );
```

Returns **[api][2]** The SDK instance.

## config

The configuration object. This object defines what different configuration
values you can use when instantiating the SDK using the [create][3] function.

### config.logs

Configuration options for the Logs feature.

The SDK will log information about the operations it is performing. The
amount of information will depend on how the Logs feature is configured.

The format of logs can also be customized by providing a
[LogHandler][4]. This function will receive a
[LogEntry][5] which it can handle as it sees fit. By
default, the SDK will log information to the console. For more
information, see the [Logs feature][6] description.

### MediaConstraint

The MediaConstraint type defines the format for configuring media options.
Either the `exact` or `ideal` property should be provided. If both are present, the
`exact` value will be used.

When the `exact` value is provided, it will be the only value considered for the option.
If it cannot be used, the constraint will be considered an error.

When the `ideal` value is provided, it will be considered as the optimal value for the option.
If it cannot be used, the closest acceptable value will be used instead.

A string value can be provided directly instead of using the MediaConstraint format.
Using a string directly is not recommended, since behaviour may differ depending
on browser and media property. For most properties, a direct string value will be
handled as `ideal` behaviour, but some properties may follow the `exact` behaviour
(eg. `deviceId`).

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `exact` **[string][8]?** The required value for the constraint. Other values will not be accepted.
*   `ideal` **[string][8]?** The ideal value for the constraint. Other values will be considered if necessary.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Specify video resolution when making a call.
client.call.make(destination, {
   audio: true,
   video: true,
   videoOptions: {
     // Set height and width constraints to ideally be 1280x720.

     width: { ideal: 1280 }
   }
})
```

### MediaOffered

The MediaOffered type defines what media capabilities are offered by the person making a call.
This is an optional property and therefore may be null if it is not known or if it's associated with caller's side of the call.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `audio` **[boolean][11]** Specifies if any audio capability has been offered by the caller. If set to true, then the caller is capable of supporting at least one audio stream in the current call.
*   `video` **[boolean][11]** Specifies if any video capability has been offered by the caller. If set to true, then the caller is capable of supporting at least one video stream in the current call.

### BandwidthControls

The BandwidthControls type defines the format for configuring media and/or track bandwidth options.
BandwidthControls only affect received remote tracks of the specified type.

### CustomParameter

Custom SIP headers can be used to convey additional information to a SIP endpoint.

These parameters must be configured on the server prior to making a request, otherwise the request will fail when trying to include the parameters.

These parameters can be specified with the [call.make][41] and [call.answer][42] APIs.
They can also be set after a Call is established using the [call.setCustomParameters][43] API, and sent using the [call.sendCustomParameters][44] API.

Custom headers may be received anytime throughout the duration a call. A remote endpoint may send custom headers when starting a call,
answering a call, or during call updates such as hold/unhold and addition/removal of media in the call.
When these custom headers are received, the SDK will emit a [call:customParameters][45] event
which will contain the custom parameters that were received.

A Call's custom parameters are stored on the Call's [CallObject][46],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][29] or
[call.getAll][28] APIs. These are the parameters that will be sent to the remote
endpoint of the Call. Parameters received from a Call are not stored as
part of the CallObject and are only provided via the [call:customParameters][45] event.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the custom parameter
*   `value` **[string][8]** The value of the custom parameter

#### Examples

```javascript
// Specify custom parameters when making a call.
client.call.make(destination, mediaConstraints,
 {
   customParameters: [
     {
       name: 'X-GPS',
       value: '42.686032,23.344565'
     }
   ]
 }
)
```

### make

Starts an outgoing call to a [SIP_URI][47] or a
[TEL_URI][48].

The call will be tracked by a unique ID that is returned by the API. The
application will use this ID to identify and control the call after it
has been initiated.

The [call.getById][29] API can be used to retrieve
the current information about the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][50] event
locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
receives the call, a [call:receive][51]
event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (eg. microphone)
in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
permissions.

client.on('call:start', function (params) {
  const { callId, error } = params
  if (error) {
    // Call failed to initialize.
  } else {
    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

Returns **[string][8]** The generated ID of the newly created call.

### reject

Rejects an incoming call.

The specified call to reject must be in a ringing state with an incoming
direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified, through their own
[call:stateChange][56] event, that the
call was rejected.

#### Parameters

direction. The call will become connected as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. This indicates that the
call has connected with the remote participant. The
[call.getById][29] API can be used to retrieve the latest call state
after the change. Further events will be emitted to indicate that the
call has received media from the remote participant. See the
[call:newTrack][57] event for more
information about this.

The SDK requires access to the system's media devices (eg. microphone)
in order to answer a call. If it does not already have permissions to
use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
permissions.

### sendRingingFeedback

Sends the "ringing feedback" notification to the remote participant of a call.

When using the 'manual' `ringingFeedbackMode` configuration, the application
is responsible for transitioning the call into the `Ringing` state. This
API will notify both ends of the call to enter `Ringing` state at the same
time. The application may decide not to send the "ringing feedback"
notification by not using this API. The `ringingFeedbackMode` configuration
must be set to 'manual' to use this API.

The specified call must be an incoming call in `Initiated` state. The call
will enter `Ringing` state as a result of the operation.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant will
be notified of the operation through a
[call:stateChange][56] event as well.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.

### ignore

Ignores an incoming call.

The specified call to ignore must be in a ringing state with an incoming
direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will not be notified that the call was ignored.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to ignore.

### hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][58] API.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified of the operation through a
[call:stateChange][56] event as well.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to hold.

### unhold

Takes a call off hold.

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified of the operation through a
[call:stateChange][56] event as well.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to unhold.

### setCustomParameters

Set the [Custom Parameters][59] of a Call, to be provided to the remote endpoint.

The specified parameters will be saved as part of the call's information throughout the duration of the call.
All subsequent call operations will include these custom parameters.
Therefore, invalid parameters, or parameters not previously configured on the server, will cause subsequent call operations to fail.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][46],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][29] or
[call.getAll][28] APIs.

The custom parameters set on a call can be sent directly with the [call.sendCustomParameters][44] API.

Custom parameters can be removed from a call's information by setting them as undefined (e.g., `call.setCustomParameters(callId)`).
Subsequent call operations will no longer send custom parameters.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
*   `customParameters` **[Array][14]<[call.CustomParameter][35]>** The custom parameters to set.

### sendCustomParameters

Send the custom parameters on an ongoing call to the server. The server may either consume the headers or relay them
to another endpoint, depending on how the server is configured.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][46],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][29] or
[call.getAll][28] APIs.

To change or remove the custom parameters on a call, use the [call.setCustomParameters][43] API.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call being acted on.

### getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

#### Examples

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][14]<[call.CallObject][60]>** Call objects.

### getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **[call.CallObject][60]** A call object.

### end

Ends an ongoing call.

The SDK will stop any/all local media associated with the call. Events
will be emitted to indicate which media tracks were stopped. See the
[call:trackEnded][61] event for more
information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
will be notified, through their own
[call:stateChange][56] event, that the
call was ended.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to end.

### addMedia

Add new media tracks to an ongoing call.
Will get new media tracks from the specific sources to add to the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][57] event
both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
added to the Call.

### stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
[call.removeMedia][63] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][61]
event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
has been removed.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.

### startScreenshare

Adds local screenshare to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
same behaviour.

The [call.addMedia][62] API can be used to perform the same behaviour
as `startScreenshare`. {@link call.addMedia} is a general-purpose API
for adding media to a call, which covers the same functionality as
`startScreenshare`. Selecting only screen options when using
[call.addMedia][62] will perform the same behaviour as using
`startScreenshare`.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Select media options for adding only screenshare.
const media = {
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   screenOptions: { ... }
}

// Add the selected media to the call.
client.call.addMedia(callId, media)
```

### stopScreenshare

Removes local screenshare from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being
sent to the remote participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
same behaviour.

The [call.removeMedia][63] API can be used to perform the same
behaviour as `stopScreenshare`. {@link call.removeMedia} is a
general-purpose API for removing media from a call, which covers the
same functionality as `stopScreenshare`. Specifying only the screen
track when using [call.removeMedia][63] will perform the same
behaviour as using `stopScreenshare`.

There is a caveat that if a Call has multiple video tracks (for example,
both a video and a screen track), the SDK itself cannot yet
differentiate one from the other. The application will need to know
which track was the screen track in this scenario.

#### Examples

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of any/all video tracks on the call.
const videoTracks = call.localTracks.filter(trackId => {
   const track = call.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   // Both video and screen tracks have kind of 'video'.
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Pick out the screen track.
const screenTrack = videoTracks[0]

// Remove screen from the call.
client.call.removeMedia(callId, [ screenTrack ])
```

### sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `tone` **[string][8]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are \['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','\*' and ','].
*   `duration` **[number][12]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
*   `intertoneGap` **[number][12]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

### getStats

Retrieve a snapshot of the low-level information of the Call through statistical
report.

The data retrieved is a [RTCStatsReport][64]
object, which contains many individual
[RTCStats][65].
These are advanced statistics gathered by the browser providing insights
into the Call at a certain point in time. Aggregating reports over a
period of time would allow a low-level analysis of the Call for that
period. As an example, this could be done to determine the media quality
during the Call.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific
Track of the Call.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, will contain the report of the particlar call.
The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a
[call:statsReceived][66] event, after
the operation completes, that has the report.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
*   `trackId` **[string][8]?** ID of a Track being used by the Call. If not
    provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

#### Examples

```javascript
client.on('call:statsReceived', function (params) {
   // Iterate over each individual statistic inside the RTCPStatsReport.
   params.result.forEach(stats => {
       // Handle the data on its own or collate with previously gathered stats
       //    for analysis.
       ...
   })
})

// Get a snapshot of the Call's stats.
//   This may be done on a regular interval to collect data over time.
client.call.getStats(callId)
```

### forward

Forwards an incoming call to another user.

The specified destination will receive the Call instead of the current
user.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][56]
event after the operation completes.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][52] | [call.TEL_URI][53])** The destination to forward the call to.

### consultativeTransfer

Performs a "consultative" transfer between two ongoing calls (also known
as an announced or warm transfer). This allows the current user to
transfer the remote participant of a call to another user, after
having spoken to both users.

Both calls used for the transfer must be locally held. After the
operation, these calls will be ended, as indicated by a
[call:stateChange][56] event.

Both remote participants will see their call be unheld by the operation,
as indicated by a
[call:stateChange][56] event, and will
be connected to one another afterwards.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event. Both local
calls will receive this event, since it is an operation on both calls,
and the remote calls will receive it as if it were a "remote unhold"
operation.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `otherCallId` **[string][8]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### directTransfer

Performs a "direct" transfer on a call (also known as an unannounced or
blind transfer). This allows the current user to transfer the remote
participant of a call to another user, similar to a "forward"
operation.

The specified call must be locally held. After the operation, this call
will be ended, as indicated by a
[call:stateChange][56] event.

The "destination" user will receive an incoming call, and when answered,
they will be connected with the remote participant of the specified
call.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event. The remote
participant being transferred will receive it as if it were a "remote
unhold" operation.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][52] | [call.TEL_URI][53])** The destination to transfer the call to.

### join

Performs a "join" on two ongoing calls.
This allows the current user to establish a call with audio with two
remote users.

Both specified calls must be locally held. The new, "joined" call will be
audio-only, even if either previous call had video. Video cannot be
added to the "joined" call. Both remote participants will see their
call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
participants after the operation. Both previous calls for the current
user will be ended after the operation, as indicated by a
[call:stateChange][56] event.

If the first call specified has custom parameters set, these parameters will be carried over to the new call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event. Both remote
participants will also receive this event as if it were a "remote
unhold" operation.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** ID of the call being acted on.
*   `otherCallId` **[string][8]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

The SDK will emit a
[call:trackReplaced][67] event
locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
*   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the track to replace.
*   `media` **[Object][7]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `media.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the audio track.

        *   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][54]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    *   `media.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][7]?** Options for configuring the video track.

        *   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][54]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        *   `media.videoOptions.height` **[call.MediaConstraint][54]?** The height of the video.
        *   `media.videoOptions.width` **[call.MediaConstraint][54]?** The width of the video.
        *   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[call.MediaConstraint][54]?** The frame rate of the video.

#### Examples

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Can also replace the specified video track of the call with a new
// screen sharing track because screen sharing is delivered as a video stream to remote peer.
// User will then be prompted to pick a specific screen to share and thus the device id will be selected.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a screen sharing track.
  // Note that 'screenOptions' property is not mandatory, as API will use default values
  // for properties like: width, height, frameRate.
  screen: true
})
```

### getAvailableCodecs

Retrieve the list of available and supported codecs based on the browser's capabilities for sending media.

This API will return a promise which, when resolved, it will contain the list of available and supported codecs.
In addition, the SDK emits a [call:availableCodecs][68] event
upon retrieving that list of codecs.

This API is a wrapper for the static method [RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities()][69].
Firefox browser does not currently support this method. Therefore, this API will not work on Firefox.

#### Parameters

*   `kind` **[string][8]** The kind of media, i.e., 'audio' or 'video', to get the list of available codecs of.

### setSdpHandlers

Set [SDP Handler Functions][70] that will be run as part of a pipeline for all future calls.
This will replace any SDP Handlers that were previously set.

SDP handlers can be used to make modifications to the SDP (e.g., removing certain codecs)
before they are processed or sent to the other side.

This is an advanced feature, changing the SDP handlers mid-call may cause
unexpected behaviour in future call operations for that call.

#### Parameters

*   `sdpHandlers` **[Array][14]<[call.SdpHandlerFunction][18]>** The list of SDP handler functions to modify SDP.

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.
Unless stated otherwise, the Call's state pertains to both caller & callee.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][46],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][29] or
[call.getAll][28] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][56]
event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `INITIATING` **[string][8]** The (outgoing) call is being started. While in this state, no Call operations can be performed until Call gets into Initiated state.
*   `INITIATED` **[string][8]** A call has been started and both the callee and caller may now perform further operations on the call object.
*   `RINGING` **[string][8]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
*   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][8]** The call has not been answered, but media
    is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
    system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
    supported, this state may replace the Ringing state. This is a state valid only for caller's side.
*   `CANCELLED` **[string][8]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered. This is a state valid only for callee's side.
*   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
*   `ON_HOLD` **[string][8]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
*   `ENDED` **[string][8]** The call has ended.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

### mediaConnectionStates

Possible states that a Call's media connection can be in.

A Call's media connection state describes the current status of media within the call.
An application should use this state to understand whether the Call participants are
able to see/hear each other or may be experiencing connection issues. The media connection
state can be used alongside the [Call state][31] to determine if media issues
are occurring while the participants are expecting to be connected.

An important state to check for is the `FAILED` state. This state signifies that there is no
media connection between the call participants and an action must be taken to resolve the
problem. Using the [call.restartMedia][71] API will attempt to reconnect the media. See
the [call.restartMedia][71] API description for more information.

These states are direct reflections of the possible
[RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState][72] values.

The Call's media connection state is a property of the [CallObject][46],
which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][29] or
[call.getAll][28] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:mediaConnectionChange][73]
event when a Call's media connection state changes from one state to another.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `NEW` **[string][8]** The Call is initializing the local side of the connection and waiting on information from the remote side.
    When the information is received, the state will transition into `checking` as the Call automatically begins the connection process.
*   `CHECKING` **[string][8]** The Call has received information from the remote endpoint and is working to establish the media connection.
    When finished, the state will transition to either `connected` or `failed`.
*   `CONNECTED` **[string][8]** A usable connection has been made and the Call will now have media.
    The connection may not be optimal, though, so the Call will continue establishment to improve the connection before going into the `completed` state.
*   `COMPLETED` **[string][8]** The media connection process has fully completed and the optimal connection has been established. While in this state,
    the Call endpoints will receive each other's media.
*   `DISCONNECTED` **[string][8]** Media has become disconnected and the Call endpoints have stopped receiving each other's media.
    The Call will automatically attempt to reconnect, transitioning back to `completed` if successful or to `failed` if not.
*   `FAILED` **[string][8]** The connection has failed and cannot be recovered automatically. A full media connection refresh is required to restablish a connection. See the [call.restartMedia][71] API.
*   `CLOSED` **[string][8]** The connection has been shut down and is no longer in use.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Use the media connection states to check the status of the media connection of the Call.
client.on('call:mediaConnectionChange', function (params) {
  // Retrieve the state of the Call this event is for.
  const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
  const mediaConnectionStates = client.call.mediaConnectionStates

  // Check the mediaConnectionState to determine which scenario the call is in.
  switch (call.mediaConnectionState) {
    case mediaConnectionStates.CONNECTED:
    case mediaConnectionStates.COMPLETED:
      // Media established: The Call's media is connected. The Call's participants
      //    are able to see/hear each other.
      // These states will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.NEW:
    case mediaConnectionStates.CHECKING:
    case mediaConnectionStates.DISCONNECTED:
      // Media pending: The Call's media is not connected. The Call is working
      //    to connect media automatically.
      // These states will occur during Call establishment and may occur midcall if there are
      //    connection issues (eg. poor network quality) or a Call participant has changed (eg. transfer).
      ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.FAILED:
     // Media has failed. The call requires a media refresh to restablish.
     // This state will occur after the `DISCONNECTED` state is encountered.
     ...
      break
    case mediaConnectionStates.CLOSED:
      // Media ended due to the Call being ended.
      // This state will occur after Call establishment.
      ...
      break
  }
}
```

### restartMedia

Attempt to re-establish a media connection for a call.

This API will perform a "refresh" operation on the call with the intention
of resolving media issues that may have been encountered. This API is only
necessary after the Call's [mediaConnectionState][32]
has entered the `failed` state, but may be used in other scenarios.

After the operation completes successfully, the Call will be re-establishing
its media connection. By this time, or shortly after, the Call's
[mediaConnectionState][32] should have
transitioned to `checking` (via a
{@link call.event:call:mediaConnectionChange call:mediaConnectionChange}
event) to signify the re-establishment. It will then transition to either
`connected` or `failed` state, similar to during the initial Call establishment.

If this operation fails, then the Call will not attempt the re-establishment
and will remain in the `failed` [mediaConnectionState][32].

Behaviour during the operation may differ slightly based on the browser.
Notably, Firefox will always transition to the `checking`
[mediaConnectionState][32] no matter what
the previous state was. Whereas Chrome will skip the `checking` state,
transitioning directly to either `connected` or `failed`. This has the
implication for Chrome that if the state does not change (for example,
the Call is in the `failed` state before the media restart operation,
and media re-establishment fails), then there will be no
[call:mediaConnectionChange][73]
event emitted. For this reason, Chrome-based applications may need a
short delay after receiving the [call:mediaRestart][74]
event before checking the Call's updated
[mediaConnectionState][32] to ensure the
application is acting on the "latest" state.

The SDK will emit a [call:mediaRestart][74]
event when the operation completes.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
[call:operation][49] event.

#### Parameters

*   `callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call to act on.

### setDefaultDevices

The `setDefaultDevices` API from previous SDK releases (3.X) has been
deprecated in the latest releases (4.X+). The SDK no longer keeps
track of "default devices" on behalf of the application.

The devices used for a call can be selected as part of the APIs for
starting the call. Microphone and/or camera can be chosen in the
[call.make][41] and [call.answer][42] APIs, and speaker can be
chosen when the audio track is rendered with the
[media.renderTracks][75] API.

### changeInputDevices

Changes the camera and/or microphone used for a Call's media input.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeInputDevices` API can be implemented
using the general-purpose [call.replaceTrack][76] API. This API can
be used to replace an existing media track with a new track of the
same type, allowing an application to change certain aspects of the
media, such as input device.

#### Examples

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's video track.
const videoTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Select the new video options.
const media = {
   video: true,
   videoOptions: {
       deviceId: 'cameraId'
   }
}

// Change the call's camera by replacing the video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack, media)
```

### changeSpeaker

Changes the speaker used for a Call's audio output. Supported on
browser's that support HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId().

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeSpeaker` API can be implemented by
re-rendering the Call's audio track.  A speaker can be selected when
rendering an audio track, so changing a speaker can be simulated
by unrendering the track with [media.removeTracks][77], then
re-rendering it with a new speaker with [media.renderTracks][75].

#### Examples

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's audio track.
const audioTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'audio'
})

// Where the audio track was previously rendered.
const audioContainer = ...

// Unrender the audio track we want to change speaker for.
client.media.removeTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer)
// Re-render the audio track with a new speaker.
client.media.renderTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer, {
   speakerId: 'speakerId'
})
```

### SIP_URI

The SIP URI ie: sip:joe@domain.com

Type: [string][8]

### TEL_URI

The TEL URI ie: tel:+18885559876

Type: [string][8]

### call:operation

A call operation has either started, been updated, or finished.

Information about ongoing call operations are stored with the call
information (see the [call.getById][29] API). This event indicates that
an operation's information has been changed.

Local call operations will be tracked from start to finish. An operation may
be updated as it progresses, based on the status of the operation. The
operation status may be ongoing or pending, depending if the operation is
waiting on activity on the local or remote end of the call, respectively.

Except in the case of slow-start operations, remote operations will only be
tracked as a "finish", to indicate that it occurred.

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
    *   `params.local` **[boolean][11]** Whether the new media is local or not.
    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][14]** The list of new Tracks.
    *   `params.mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Media object the Tracks belong to.

### call:removedMedia

Media has been removed from the call.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call.
    *   `params.local` **[boolean][11]** Whether the removed Media was local or not.
    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][14]** The list of removed Tracks.

### call:newTrack

A new Track has been added to the Call.

The Track may have been added by either the local user or remote user using
the [call.addMedia][62] API.

Information about the Track can be retrieved using the
[media.getTrackById][78] API.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call the track was added to.
    *   `params.mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the media the track was added to.
    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the newly added track.
    *   `params.local` **[boolean][11]** Whether the track is local or not (remote)

### call:trackEnded

A Track has been removed from a Call.

The Track may have been removed by either the local user or remote user using
the [call.removeMedia][63] API. Tracks are also removed from Calls
automatically while the Call is on hold.

Note that receiving this event is not an indication that a media operation
has completed. Therefore the application should not assume it is safe to
perform a new operation at this time. To be notified when a call has had
its media removed, see [call:removedMedia][79]

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the call the track was removed from.
    *   `params.mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the media the track was removed from.
    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the removed track.
    *   `params.local` **[boolean][11]** Whether the track was local or not (remote)

usage.

The [call:mediaConnectionChange][73] event
will also be emitted alongside this event when the media restart operation is
successful.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.callId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Call that was acted on.

client.on('call:mediaRestart', function (params) {
   if (params.error) {
     // The operation failed. May want to determine whether to re-attempt the
     //    operation (if the failure was simply a connectivity issue) or to
     //    consider the call's media irrecoverable.
     ...
   } else {
     // The call should be re-establishing media, with the call's
     //    `mediaConnectionState` being updated.
     const mediaState = client.call.getById(params.callId).mediaConnectionState
     ...

### Message

A Message object is a means by which a sender can deliver information to a recipient.

Creating and sending a message:

A message object can be obtained through the [Conversation.createMessage][89] API on an existing conversation.

Messages have Parts which represent pieces of a message, such as a text part, a json object part or a file part.
Once all the desired parts have been added to the message using the [Message.addPart][91] function,
the message can then be sent using the [Message.send][92] function.

Once the sender sends a message, this message is saved in sender's state as an object.
Similarly, once the recipient gets a message, this message is saved in recipient's state.

Retrieving a delivered message:

Once a message is delivered successfully, it can be
obtained through the [Conversation.getMessages][93] or [Conversation.getMessage][94] API on an existing conversation.

Below are the properties pertaining to the message object, returned by Conversation.getMessage(s) APIs, for either sender or recipient.

## logger

The SDK has an internal logging system for providing information about its
behaviour. The SDK will generate logs, at different levels for different
types of information, which are routed to a
"[Log Handler][4]" for consumption. An application
can provide their own Log Handler (see
[config.logs][96]) to customize how the logs are
handled, or allow the default Log Handler to print the logs to the
console.

The SDK's default Log Handler is merely a thin wrapper around the browser's
console API (ie. `window.console`). It receives the log generated by the
SDK, called a "[Log Entry][5]", formats a
human-readable message with it, then uses the console to log it at the
appropriate level. This is important to be aware of, since your browser's
console may affect how you see the SDK's default log messages. Since the
default Log Handler uses the console's levels, the browser may filter
which messages are shown depending on which levels it has configured. For
a user that understands console log levels, this can be helpful for
filtering the logs to only the relevant information. But it can equally
be a hindrance by hiding the more detailed log messages (at the 'debug'
level), since browser can have this level hidden by default. For this
reason, we recommend providing a custom Log Handler to the SDK that is
better suited for your application and its users.

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

The SDK will provide [Log Entries][5] to the
[Log Handler][4] for all logs at or above the set
log level. 'debug' is considered the lowest level and 'silent' the
highest level. For example, if the current level is 'info', then the
[Log Handler][4] will receive
[Log Entries][5] for logs at 'info', 'warn', and
'error', but not for the 'debug' level.

#### Properties

*   `SILENT` **[string][8]** Nothing will be logged.
*   `ERROR` **[string][8]** Unhandled error information will be logged. If
    the SDK encounters an issue it cannot resolve, the error will be included
    in the logs. This likely points to an issue with the SDK itself or an
    issue with how the SDK is being used.
*   `WARN` **[string][8]** Warning messages for the application developer will
    be logged. If the SDK encounters an issue that it can recover and continue,
    a warning about the issue will be included in the logs. These logs point
    to issues that need to be handled by the application. For example, providing
    an invalid configuration to the SDK will cause a warning log that explains
    the issue.
*   `INFO` **[string][8]** General information about the SDK's operations will
    be logged, outlining how the SDK is handling the operations. Reading through
    these logs should provide a high-level view of what the SDK is doing,
    and why it is doing it.
*   `DEBUG` **[string][8]** Detailed information about the SDK's operations,
    meant for debugging issues, will be logged. Specific information and relevant
    operation data are provided for understanding the scenario that the SDK
    was in during the operation.

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
[config.logs][96]) will need to handle LogEntry
objects.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `timestamp` **[number][12]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
*   `method` **[string][8]** The log function that was used to create the log.
*   `level` **[string][8]** The level of severity the log.
*   `target` **[Object][7]** The subject that the log is about.

    *   `target.type` **[string][8]** The type of the target. This is also
        used as part of the name of the Logger.
    *   `target.id` **[string][8]?** A unique identifer for the target.
    *   `target.name` **[string][8]** A combination of the target type and ID. If no
        id was provided, this will be the same as the type.
*   `messages` **[Array][14]** The logged information, given to the Logger
    method as parameters.
*   `timer` **[Object][7]?** Timing data, if the log method was a timer method.

#### Examples

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
[config.logs][96]). The SDK will then provide this
function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][17]

#### Parameters

*   `LogEntry` **[Object][7]** The LogEntry to be logged.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, target } = logEntry
  let { method } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  // For the timer methods, don't actually use the console methods.
  //    The Logger already did the timing, so simply log out the info.
  if (['time', 'timeLog', 'timeEnd'].includes(method)) {
    method = 'debug'
  }

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][97]
feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
"remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
the [media.getDevices][98] API.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][99] event will be
emitted when the available media devices have changed.

Returns **[Object][7]** The lists of camera, microphone, and speaker devices.

### getById

Retrieves an available Media object with a specific Media ID.

#### Parameters

*   `mediaId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Media to retrieve.

Returns **[call.MediaObject][100]** A Media object.

### getTrackById

Retrieve an available Track object with a specific Track ID.

#### Parameters

*   `trackId` **[string][8]** The ID of the Track to retrieve.

Returns **[call.TrackObject][39]** A Track object.

### initializeDevices

Requests permission to access media devices on the end-user's machine.

This API will trigger the browser to ask the end-user for permission to
access their camera and/or microphone. These permissions are
needed for the SDK to read information about the devices (the label,
for example) and for using the devices for a call.

If the browser does not yet have permission, it will prompt the end-user
with a small pop-up window, giving the user a chance to allow/deny the
permissions. The behaviour of this pop-up window differs slightly
based on the browser; it may automatically save the user's decision
(such as in Chrome and Safari) or it may require the user to choose
whether their decision should be saved (such as in Firefox).

This API is not required for proper usage of media and/or calls, but
helps to prepare a user before a call is made or received. It allows
an application to prompt the user for device permissions when it is
convenient for them, rather than during call setup. If the user saves
their decision, they will not be prompted again when the SDK accesses
those devices for a call.

For device information, the [media.getDevices][98] API will retrieve
the list of media devices available for the SDK to use. If this list
is empty, or is missing information, it is likely that the browser
does not have permission to access the device's information. We
recommend using the [media.initializeDevices][101] API in this
scenario if you would like to allow the end-user to select which
device(s) they would like to use when they make a call, rather than
using the system default.

The SDK will emit a [devices:change][99]
event when the operation is successful or a
[devices:error][102] event if an error is
encountered.

#### Parameters

*   `constraints` **[Object][7]?** 

    *   `constraints.audio` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for audio device permissions. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `constraints.video` **[boolean][11]** Whether to ask for video device permissions. (optional, default `true`)

#### Examples

```javascript
// The SDK will ask for both audio and video permissions by default.
client.media.initializeDevices()

// The SDK will only ask for audio permissions.
client.media.initializeDevices({ audio: true, video: false })
```

### renderTracks

Render Media Tracks in a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
*   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
    identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
    escaped.
*   `options` **[Object][7]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.

    *   `options.speakerId` **[string][8]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

#### Examples

```javascript
// When a Call receives a new track, render it.
client.on('call:newTrack', function (params) {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(params.trackId)
   const container = params.local ? localContainer : remoteContainer

   // Render the Call's new track when it first becomes available.
   client.media.renderTracks([ track.trackId ], container)
})
```

### removeTracks

Remove Media Tracks from a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs to stop being rendered.
*   `cssSelector` **[string][8]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
    identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
    escaped.

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks at their media source.

Prevents media from being received for the Tracks. Audio Tracks will
become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][103] event
when a Track has been muted.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume as normal for the Tracks.

The SDK will emit a [media:unmuted][104] event
when a Track has been unmuted.

#### Parameters

*   `trackIds` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of Track IDs.

### devices:change

The media devices available for use have changed.

Information about the available media devices can be retrieved using the
[media.getDevices][98] API.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Listen for changes to available media devices.
client.on('devices:change', function () {
   // Retrieve the latest media device lists.
   const devices = client.media.getDevices()
})
```

### devices:error

An error occurred while trying to access media devices.

The most common causes of this error are when the browser does not have
permission from the end-user to access the devices, or when the browser
cannot find a media device that fulfills the
[MediaConstraint(s)][105] that was provided.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.error` **[Error][20]** The Basic error object.

### media:muted

The specified Tracks have been muted.

A Track can be muted using the [media.muteTracks][106] API.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** The list of Tracks that were muted.

### media:unmuted

The specified Tracks have been unmuted.

A Track can be unmuted using the [media.unmuteTracks][107]
API.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.tracks` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** The list of Tracks that were unmuted.

### media:sourceMuted

The specified Track has had its media source muted.

The Track is still active, but is not receiving media any longer. An audio
track will be silent and a video track will be a black frame. It is
possible for the track to start receiving media again (see the
[media:sourceUnmuted][108] event).

This event is generated outside the control of the SDK. This may happen for a
local track if the browser or end-user stops allowing the SDK to access
the media device, for example. This may happen for a remote track during a
call when the remote endpoint stops sending media during a hold operation,
for example.

Handling this event is only required if you are using `unified-plan` as the
`sdpSemantics` setting in the SDK's configuration. This setting will become
the default in an upcoming release.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The track that is affected as a result of media source being muted.

### media:sourceUnmuted

The specified Track has started receiving media from its source once again.

The Track returns to the state before it was muted (see the
[media:sourceMuted][109] event), and will
be able to display video or play audio once again.

This event is generated outside the control of the SDK, when the cause of the
media source being muted had been undone.

Handling this event is only required if you are using `unified-plan` as the
`sdpSemantics` setting in the SDK's configuration. This setting will become
the default in an upcoming release.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.trackId` **[string][8]** The track that is affected as a result of media source being unmuted.

## presence

The 'presence' namespace provides an interface for an application to set the
User's presence information and to track other Users' presence
information.

Presence information is persisted by the server. When the SDK is initialized,
there will be no information available. Presence information will become
available either by using [presence.fetch][111] or by subscribing for
updates about other Users, using [presence.subscribe][112].

Available presence information can be retrieved using [presence.get][113] or
[presence.getAll][114].

communicate/respond to other users in the network.
An instance of this type can be obtained by invoking the [presence.get][113] function.

Reporting when a user is on the phone is enabled (by default), which means that presence update notifications
will be sent whenever a user is in a call, as well as when the call has ended.
This is a user preference enabled or disabled on server side, and it can only be changed on the server side.

The status is set to [open][115] as soon as a user subscribes for the presence service.

## proxy

The 'proxy' namespace allows for a secondary mode for making calls: proxy mode.
When proxy mode is enabled, the SDK will redirect webRTC / media operations from the current machine to a remote machine using a channel.
This is an advanced feature that enables support for Calls in particular scenarios that would otherwise not support them.

### Channel

The Channel object that the Proxy module needs to be provided.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Examples

```javascript
// The channel the application uses for communicating with a remote endpoint.
const appChannel = ...

// The channel the application will provide to the Proxy module for use.
const channel = {
   send: function (data) {
     // Any encoding / wrapping needed for a Proxy message being sent
     //    over the channel.
     appChannel.sendMessage(data)
   },
   // The Proxy module will set this function.
   receive: undefined
}
appChannel.on('message', data => {
   // Any decoding / unwrapping needed for the received message.
   channel.receive(data)
})

client.proxy.setChannel(channel)
```

#### send

Channel function that the Proxy module will use to send messages to the remote side.

##### Parameters

*   `data` **[Object][7]** Message to be sent over the channel.

#### receive

API that the Proxy module will assign a listener function for accepting received messages.
This function should receive all messages sent from the remote side of the channel.

##### Parameters

*   `data` **[Object][7]** The message received from the Channel.

### setProxyMode

Sets the mode for the Proxy Plugin.
When enabled, webRTC operations will be proxied over a channel. Enabling
proxy mode requires a channel to have been set. See `setChannel` API.
When disabled, webRTC operation will occur as normal on the local machine.

#### Parameters

*   `value` **[boolean][11]** Whether proxy mode should be enabled.

### getProxyMode

Retrieves the current mode of the Proxy Plugin.

Returns **[boolean][11]** Whether proxy mode is currently enabled.

### getInfo

Retrieve information about the proxy.

#### Examples

```javascript
const proxy = client.proxy.getInfo()

log(`Proxy Browser in use: ${proxy.browser}, mode: ${proxy.proxyMode}, channel: ${proxy.hasChannel}, initialized: ${proxy.remoteInitialized}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** \[proxy] Object containing information about the proxy.

Returns **[boolean][11]** \[proxy.proxyMode] Current operating mode.

Returns **[boolean][11]** \[proxy.hasChannel] Proxy has a channel associated with it.

Returns **[boolean][11]** \[proxy.remoteInitialized] Proxy initialization state.

Returns **[Object][7]** \[proxy.browser] Details for the browser the proxy is using.

log(`Proxy Browser in use: ${details.browser}, version ${details.version}.`)
```

Returns **[Object][7]** Object containing `browser` and `version` information.

### setChannel

Sets the channel to be used while proxy mode is enabled.

#### Parameters

*   `channel` **[proxy.Channel][121]** See the `Channel` module for information.

### initializeRemote

Sends an initialization message over the channel with webRTC configurations.

The version of the SDK and the Remote SDK must be the same, otherwise
initialization will fail.

#### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][7]** 

### proxy:change

The Proxy state has changed.
Indicates either a change in the mode or the channel.

### proxy:error

An error has occurred with a Proxy operation.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.error` **[Object][7]** An error object.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][70]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios.

Note that SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They can be added during
initialization of the SDK using the [config.call.sdpHandlers][122] configuration
parameter. They can also be set after the SDK's creation by using the
[call.setSdpHandlers][123] function.

### Examples

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

```javascript
// Through the Call API post-instantiation
client.call.setSdpHandlers([ codecRemover, <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...])
```

### CodecSelector

An object that represents a selector to match codecs of an RTP map in SDP.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `name` **[string][8]** The name of the codec.
*   `fmtpParams` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** An array of strings to match against the "a=fmtp" format parameters for the corresponding codec.
    All of the elements in the array must be contained in the "a=fmtp" attribute in order to be a match.

### createCodecRemover

This function creates an SDP handler that will remove codecs matching the selectors specified for SDP offers and answers.

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to remote parties. For example, some legacy call services limit the SDP
length (usually to 4KB) and will reject calls that have SDP size above this amount.

While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the createCodecRemover function creates a codec removal handler that can be used for this purpose. Applications can use this codec
removal handler in combination with the [call.getAvailableCodecs][82] function in order to build logic to determine the best codecs to use
for their application.

#### Parameters

*   `codecs` **([Array][14]\<CodecSelector> | [Array][14]<[string][8]>)** A list of codec selectors to remove from the SDP. If passing a list of strings, they will be converted into
    codec selectors that correspond to those names without any extra FMTP parameters.

#### Examples

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';

const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover([
  // Remove all VP8 and VP9 codecs.
  'VP8',
  'VP9',

  // Remove all H264 codecs with the specified FMTP parameters.
  {
    name: 'H264',
    fmtpParams: ['profile-level-id=4d0032', 'packetization-mode=1']
  }
])

const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[call.SdpHandlerFunction][18]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## services

The 'services' namespace allows an application to manage how they wish the SDK to
receive communications from the platform. An application can subscribe to
services in order to receive updates about that service for the current
user. A feature generally requires a subscription for its service to be
fully functional.

The services an application can subscribe to are based on the features
included in the SDK. The list of available services can be retrieved
using the [services.getSubscriptions][124] API. These values can be used
with the [services.subscribe][15] API.

The channel used for subscriptions is the method for receiving the service
updates. The recommended channel is `websocket`, where the SDK is able to
handle receiving the updates internally. Alternate channel methods, if a
websocket cannot be used, will be available in the future.

### ServiceDescriptor

The ServiceDescriptor type defines the format for specifying how to subscribe for a certain service.
This is the service configuration object that needs to be passed (as part of an array of configuration objects) when calling
the [services.subscribe][15] function.
Only some plugins (`call`, `messaging` and `presence`) support such configuration object that needs to be passed
to the subscribe function.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `service` **[string][8]** The name of the available service user wants to subscribe to.
    The available service names are `chat`, `presence`, `call` and `smsinbound`.
*   `params` **[Object][7]?** An object containing any additional parameters required for subscribing to that service.
    This is an optional property as not all service subscriptions require it.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Subscribe to chat, presence & call services on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'chat'},
   {service: 'presence'},
   {service: 'call'},
], 'websocket')
```

### SmsInboundServiceParams

The SmsInboundServiceParams type defines the additional information when subscribing to SMS inbound service.
This is the configuration object that needs to be passed as the value for the [ServiceDescriptor.params][125] property.

Type: [Object][7]

#### Properties

*   `destinationAddress` **[string][8]** An E164 formatted DID number.
    The subscription created will provide notifications for inbound SMS messages destined for this address.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Subscribe to smsinbound service on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'smsinbound', params: {destinationAddress: '+18001234567'}}
], 'websocket')
```

### subscribe

Subscribes to platform notifications for an SDK service.

Extra configuration can be provide as an additional object parameter.
Currently only a "forceLogOut" flag can be supplied in this object.

For push notifications on link, please see [notifications.registerPush][126]

The SDK currently only supports the `websocket` channel as a subscription
type.

#### Parameters

*   `services` **[Array][14]<([string][8] | [services.ServiceDescriptor][127])>** A list of service configurations.
*   `options` **[Object][7]?** The options object for non-credential options.

    *   `options.type` **[string][8]** The method of how to receive service updates. (optional, default `'websocket'`)
    *   `options.clientCorrelator` **[string][8]?** Unique ID for the client. This is used by the platform to identify an instance of the application used by the specific device.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Subscribe for chat and SMS services.
client.services.subscribe(['call', 'IM'], {forceLogOut: true, clientCorrelator: 'abc123'})
```

### unsubscribe

Cancels existing subscriptions for platform notifications.

Existing subscriptions can be retrieved using the
[services.getSubscriptions][124] API. The `subscribed` values are the
services that can be unsubscribed from.

#### Parameters

*   `services` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** A list of subscribed service names.
*   `type` **[string][8]** The method of how the service updates
    are being received. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

const services = [ 'chat', 'smsinbound' ]

client.services.unsubscribe(services)
```

### getSubscriptions

Retrieves information about currently subscribed services and available services.

The `available` values are the SDK's services that an application can
subscribe to receive notifications about. A feature generally
requires a subscription to its service in order to be fully functional.

The `subscribed` values are the SDK's services that the application has
an active subscription for. Services are subscribed to using the
[services.subscribe][15] API.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Get the lists of services.
const services = client.services.getSubscriptions()

// Figure out which available services don't have a subscription.
const notSubscribed = services.available.filter(service => {
   return !services.subscribed.includes(service)
})

// Subscribe for all not-yet-subscribed services.
client.services.subscribe(notSubscribed)

    *   `params.error` **[api.BasicError][27]?** The Basic error object.

## sip

The SIP Events feature allows an application to communicate with a SIP network integrated
with their Kandy Link instance. The SIP network may generate custom events intended
for an application, which can be handled with the SDK's `sip` namespace.

Usage of SIP Events is dependent on your Kandy Link instance. The types of SIP Events can
be different based on configurations and components, often being part of a custom
solution. As such, the SIP Events feature is presented in a generic manner to be
flexible for any possible events.

An example of a common SIP event is "SIP presence". When a user is connected to a SIP phone,
the network may generate "phone presence" events when the user starts and ends a call
(eg. 'On Call', 'Available'). Applications can subscribe to receive these events for
specific users.

A SIP event may either be solicited or unsolicited. Solicited events, such as the "presence"
example above, requires the application to subscribe for the event. See the
[sip.subscribe API][128] for more information about solicited events.
Unsolicited events have no prerequisites for being received.

### subscribe

Creates a subscription for a SIP event.

A subscription is required to receive SIP notifications for solicited events. Before
creating a SIP subscription, the service for the event type must have been
provisioned as part of the user subscription using the [services.subscribe][15]
API.

Only one SIP subscription per event type can exist at a time. A subscription can
watch for events from multiple users at once. Users can be added to or removed
from a subscription using the [sip.update][129] API at any time.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][130]
event when the operations completes. The [sip.getDetails][131] API can be used
to retrieve the current information about a subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:eventsChange][132] event when
a SIP event is received.

#### Parameters

*   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.
*   `subscribeUserList` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** The list of users to receive events about.
*   `clientCorrelator` **[string][8]** Unique identifier for a client device.
*   `customParameters` **[Array][14]<[call.CustomParameter][35]>?** Custom SIP header parameters for the SIP backend.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Provision the service for the specific SIP event during user subscription.
//   This is required before a SIP subscription for the event can be created.
const services = ['call', 'event:presence', ...]
client.services.subscribe(services)

// Subscribe to receive SIP presence events from two users.
client.sip.subscribe('event:presence', ['userOne@example.com', 'userTwo@example.com'], 'clientId123')

// Subscribe for SIP events with a custom parameter.
const customParameters = [{
   name: 'X-nt-GUID',
   value: 'GUID123abc'
}]
client.sip.subscribe('event:presence', subscribeUserList, 'clientId123', customParameters)
```

### update

Updates an existing SIP event subscription.

Allows for adding or removing users from the subscription, and for changing the
custom parameters of the subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][130]
event when the operations completes. The [sip.getDetails][131] API can be used
to retrieve the current information about a subscription.

#### Parameters

*   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.
*   `userLists` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `userLists.subscribeUserList` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of users to add to the subscription.
    *   `userLists.unsubscribeUserList` **[Array][14]<[string][8]>** List of users to remove from the subscription. If all users are removed, the event subscription will be deleted.
*   `customParameters` **[Array][14]<[call.CustomParameter][35]>?** Custom SIP header parameters for the SIP backend.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Add a user to an existing subscription.
const userLists = {
   subscribedUserList: ['userThree@example.com']
}
client.sip.update('event:presence', userLists)

// Simultaneously add and remove users from the subscription.
const userLists = {
   subscribedUserList: ['userThree@example.com'],
   unsubscribeUserList: ['userOne@example.com']
}
client.sip.update('event:presence', userLists)
```

### unsubscribe

Deletes an existing SIP event subscription.

The SDK will emit a [sip:subscriptionChange][130]
event when the operations completes.

Subscription details will no longer be available using the [sip.getDetails][131]
API after it has been unsubscribed from.

#### Parameters

*   `eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Delete a SIP subscription.
client.sip.unsubscribe('event:presence')
```

### getDetails

Retrieve information about a SIP event subscription.

The SDK will track which users are included as part of the subscription and
previous notifications received. Each subscription will include a unique ID.

#### Parameters

*   `eventType` **[string][8]?** The name of a SIP event. If not provided, will retrieve
    information for all SIP subscriptions.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Retrieve information about a single SIP subscription.
const { subscribedUsers, notifications } = client.sip.getDetails('event:presence')

// Retrieve information about all current SIP subscriptions.
const subscriptions = client.sip.getDetails()
const { subscribedUsers, notifications } = subscriptions['event:presence']
```

Returns **[Object][7]** SIP subscription information. If `eventType` was not provided, will
return an object namespaced by event types.

### sip:subscriptionChange

A change has occurred to a SIP subscription.

This event can be emitted when a new SIP subscription is created ([sip.subscribe][128]
API), an existing subscription is updated ([sip.update][129] API), or has been
deleted ([sip.unsubscribe][133] API). The `change` parameter on the event indicates
which scenario caused the event.

When users are added or removed from a subscription through a new subscription or an update,
the `subscribedUsers` and `unsubscribedUsers` parameters will indicate the users added
and removed, respectively.

The [sip.getDetails][131] API can be used to retrieve the current information about
a subscription.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][7]** 

    *   `params.eventType` **[string][8]** The name of the SIP event.
    *   `params.change` **[string][8]** The change operation that triggered the event.
