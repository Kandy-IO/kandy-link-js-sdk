### make

Starts an outgoing call to a [SIP_URI][32] or a
   [TEL_URI][33].

The call will be tracked by a unique ID that is returned by the API. The
   application will use this ID to identify and control the call after it
   has been initiated.

The [call.getById][22] API can be used to retrieve
   the current information about the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][35] event
   locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
   receives the call, a [call:receive][36]
   event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

Returns **[string][7]** The generated ID of the newly created call.

### reject

Rejects an incoming call.

The specified call to reject must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][40] event, that the
   call was rejected.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to reject.

### answer

Answers an incoming call.

The specified call to answer must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will become connected as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. This indicates that the
   call has connected with the remote participant. The
   [call.getById][22] API can be used to retrieve the latest call state
   after the change. Further events will be emitted to indicate that the
   call has received media from the remote participant. See the
   [call:newTrack][41] event for more
   information about this.

The SDK requires access to the system's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to answer a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to answer.
-   `media` **[Object][6]** The media options the call should be initialized with.
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][10]** Whether the call should have audio on start. Currently, audio-less calls are not supported. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the call's audio.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][10]** Whether the call should have video on start. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.screen` **[boolean][10]** Whether the call should have screenshare on start. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the call's video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.

    -   `options.bandwidth` **[call.BandwidthControls][24]?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.
    -   `options.customParameters` **[Array][12]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][25]>?** Custom SIP header parameters for the SIP backend

### ignore

Ignores an incoming call.

The specified call to ignore must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will not be notified that the call was ignored.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to ignore.

### hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
   media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
   and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
   being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
   call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][42] API.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][40] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to hold.

### unhold

Takes a call off hold.

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
   also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
   the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][40] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to unhold.

### setCustomParameters

Set the custom parameters of a call.

The specified parameters will be saved as part of the call's information throughout the duration of the call.
All subsequent call operations will include these custom parameters.
Therefore, invalid parameters, or parameters not previously configured on the server, will cause subsequent call operations to fail.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][31],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][22] or
   [call.getAll][21] APIs.

The custom parameters set on a call can be sent directly with the [call.sendCustomParameters][29] API.

Custom parameters can be removed from a call's information by setting them as undefined (e.g., `call.setCustomParameters(callId)`).
Subsequent call operations will no longer send custom parameters.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][12]&lt;[call.CustomParameter][25]>** The custom parameters to set.

### sendCustomParameters

Send the custom parameters on an ongoing call to the server. The server may either consume the headers or relay them
to another endpoint, depending on how the server is configured.

A Call's custom parameters are a property of the Call's [CallObject][31],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][22] or
   [call.getAll][21] APIs.

To change or remove the custom parameters on a call, use the [call.setCustomParameters][28] API.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call being acted on.

### getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

**Examples**

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][12]&lt;[call.CallObject][43]>** Call objects.

### getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **[call.CallObject][43]** A call object.

### end

Ends an ongoing call.

The SDK will stop any/all local media associated with the call. Events
   will be emitted to indicate which media tracks were stopped. See the
   [call:trackEnded][44] event for more
   information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][40] event, that the
   call was ended.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to end.

### addMedia

Add new media tracks to an ongoing call.
Will get new media tracks from the specific sources to add to the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][41] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to add media to.
-   `media` **[Object][6]** The media options to add to the call. (optional, default `{}`)

-   `options` **[Object][6]?**  (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.bandwidth` **[call.BandwidthControls][24]?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.

### removeMedia

Remove tracks from an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][44]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to remove media from.
-   `tracks` **[Array][12]** A list of track IDs to remove.
-   `options` **[Object][6]?**  (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.bandwidth` **[call.BandwidthControls][24]?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.

### startVideo

Adds local video to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call does not
   already have video. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.addMedia][45] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][41] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `options` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the call's video.
    -   `options.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.

### stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
   to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
   video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.removeMedia][46] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][44]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.

### stopScreenshare

Removes local screenshare from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being
   sent to the remote participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.removeMedia][46] API can be used to perform the same
   behaviour as `stopScreenshare`. [call.removeMedia][46] is a
   general-purpose API for removing media from a call, which covers the
   same functionality as `stopScreenshare`. Specifying only the screen
   track when using [call.removeMedia][46] will perform the same
   behaviour as using `stopScreenshare`.

There is a caveat that if a Call has multiple video tracks (for example,
   both a video and a screen track), the SDK itself cannot yet
   differentiate one from the other. The application will need to know
   which track was the screen track in this scenario.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of any/all video tracks on the call.
const videoTracks = call.localTracks.filter(trackId => {
   const track = call.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   // Both video and screen tracks have kind of 'video'.
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Pick out the screen track.
const screenTrack = videoTracks[0]

// Remove screen from the call.
client.call.removeMedia(callId, [ screenTrack ])
```

### sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
   state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `tone` **[string][7]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','*' and ','].
-   `duration` **[number][11]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
-   `intertoneGap` **[number][11]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

### startScreenshare

Adds local screenshare to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.addMedia][45] API can be used to perform the same behaviour
   as `startScreenshare`. [call.addMedia][45] is a general-purpose API
   for adding media to a call, which covers the same functionality as
   `startScreenshare`. Selecting only screen options when using
   [call.addMedia][45] will perform the same behaviour as using
   `startScreenshare`.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Select media options for adding only screenshare.
const media = {
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   screenOptions: { ... }
}

// Add the selected media to the call.
client.call.addMedia(callId, media)
```

### getStats

Get a report about low-level call statistical information.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific
   Track of the Call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:statsReceived][47] event, after
   the operation completes, that has the report.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
-   `trackId` **[string][7]?** ID of a Track being used by the Call. If not
       provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

### forward

Forwards an incoming call to another user.

The specified destination will receive the Call instead of the current
   user.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][40]
   event after the operation completes.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][37] \| [call.TEL_URI][38])** The destination to forward the call to.

### consultativeTransfer

Performs a "consultative" transfer between two ongoing calls (also known
   as an announced or warm transfer). This allows the current user to
   transfer the remote participant of a call to another user, after
   having spoken to both users.

Both calls used for the transfer must be locally held. After the
   operation, these calls will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][40] event.

Both remote participants will see their call be unheld by the operation,
   as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][40] event, and will
   be connected to one another afterwards.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event. Both local
   calls will receive this event, since it is an operation on both calls,
   and the remote calls will receive it as if it were a "remote unhold"
   operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][7]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### directTransfer

Performs a "direct" transfer on a call (also known as an unannounced or
   blind transfer). This allows the current user to transfer the remote
   participant of a call to another user, similar to a "forward"
   operation.

The specified call must be locally held. After the operation, this call
   will be ended, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][40] event.

The "destination" user will receive an incoming call, and when answered,
   they will be connected with the remote participant of the specified
   call.

The progression of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event. The remote
   participant being transferred will receive it as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `destination` **([call.SIP_URI][37] \| [call.TEL_URI][38])** The destination to transfer the call to.

### join

Performs a "join" on two ongoing calls.
This allows the current user to establish a call with audio with two
   remote users.

Both specified calls must be locally held. The new, "joined" call will be
   audio-only, even if either previous call had video. Video cannot be
   added to the "joined" call. Both remote participants will see their
   call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
   participants after the operation. Both previous calls for the current
   user will be ended after the operation, as indicated by a
   [call:stateChange][40] event.

If the first call specified has custom parameters set, these parameters will be carried over to the new call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event. Both remote
   participants will also receive this event as if it were a "remote
   unhold" operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][7]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][34] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][48] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][7]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][6]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][10]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][10]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[call.MediaConstraint][39]?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

### setDefaultDevices

The `setDefaultDevices` API from previous SDK releases (3.X) has been
   deprecated in the latest releases (4.X+). The SDK no longer keeps
   track of "default devices" on behalf of the application.

The devices used for a call can be selected as part of the APIs for
   starting the call. Microphone and/or camera can be chosen in the
   [call.make][26] and [call.answer][27] APIs, and speaker can be
   chosen when the audio track is rendered with the
   [media.renderTracks][49] API.

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][31],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][22] or
   [call.getAll][21] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][40]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][7]** The (outgoing) call is being started.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][7]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received.
-   `RINGING` **[string][7]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][7]** The call has not been answered, but media
       is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
       system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
       supported, this state may replace the Ringing state.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][7]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][7]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][7]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][7]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

### changeSpeaker

Changes the speaker used for a Call's audio output. Supported on
   browser's that support HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId().

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeSpeaker` API can be implemented by
   re-rendering the Call's audio track.  A speaker can be selected when
   rendering an audio track, so changing a speaker can be simulated
   by unrendering the track with [media.removeTracks][50], then
   re-rendering it with a new speaker with [media.renderTracks][49].

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's audio track.
const audioTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'audio'
})

// Where the audio track was previously rendered.
const audioContainer = ...

// Unrender the audio track we want to change speaker for.
client.media.removeTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer)
// Re-render the audio track with a new speaker.
client.media.renderTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer, {
   speakerId: 'speakerId'
})
```

### changeInputDevices

Changes the camera and/or microphone used for a Call's media input.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeInputDevices` API can be implemented
   using the general-purpose [call.replaceTrack][51] API. This API can
   be used to replace an existing media track with a new track of the
   same type, allowing an application to change certain aspects of the
   media, such as input device.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's video track.

See the "Conversation" and "Message" sections of the documentation for more details.

Messaging functions are all part of the 'conversation' namespace. Ex: client.conversation.get('id').

### get

Get a conversation object matching the user ID provided
If successful, the event 'conversations:change' will be emitted.
If a conversation with the given user ID already exists in the store, it will be returned; otherwise, a new conversation will be created.

**Parameters**

-   `destination` **[string][7]** The destination for messages created in this conversation. This will
    be a user's sip address.

Returns **[conversation.Conversation][52]** A Conversation object.

### Message

A Message object is a means by which a sender can deliver information to a recipient.

Creating and sending a message:

A message object can be obtained through the [Conversation.createMessage][53] API on an existing conversation.

Messages have Parts which represent pieces of a message, such as a text part, a json object part or a file part.
Once all the desired parts have been added to the message using the [Message.addPart][54] function,
the message can then be sent using the [Message.send][55] function.

Once the sender sends a message, this message is saved in sender's state as an object.
Similarly, once the recipient gets a message, this message is saved in recipient's state.

Retrieving a delivered message:

Once a message is delivered successfully, it can be
obtained through the [Conversation.getMessages][56] or [Conversation.getMessage][57] API on an existing conversation.

Below are the properties pertaining to the message object, returned by Conversation.getMessage(s) APIs, for either sender or recipient.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][11]** A Unix timestamp in seconds marking the time when the message was created by sender.
-   `parts` **[Array][12]&lt;conversation.Part>** An array of Part Objects.
-   `sender` **[string][7]** The primary contact address of the sender.
-   `destination` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** An array of primary contact addresses associated with various destinations to which the message is meant to be delivered.
-   `messageId` **[string][7]** The unique id of the message. The message object (stored in sender's state) has a different id
    than the one associated with the message object stored in recipient's state.
-   `type` **[string][7]** The type of message that was sent. See [conversation.chatTypes][58] for valid types.
    This property applies only to message objects stored in sender's state.

## logger

The internal logger is used to provide information about the SDK's behaviour.
The logger can provide two types of logs: basic logs and action logs. Basic
logs are simple lines of information about what the SDK is doing during operations.
Action logs are complete information about a specific action that occurred
within the SDK, providing debug information describing it.
The amount of information logged can be configured as part of the SDK configuration.
See [config.logs][60] .

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

**Properties**

-   `SILENT` **[string][7]** Log nothing.
-   `ERROR` **[string][7]** Log only unhandled errors.
-   `WARN` **[string][7]** Log issues that may cause problems or unexpected behaviour.
-   `INFO` **[string][7]** Log useful information and messages to indicate the SDK's internal operations.
-   `DEBUG` **[string][7]** Log information to help diagnose problematic behaviour.

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
   default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
   be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
   [config.logs][60]). The SDK will then provide this
   function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][14]

**Parameters**

-   `LogEntry` **[Object][6]** The LogEntry to be logged.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, method, target } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.name} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
   logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
   and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
   [config.logs][60]) will need to handle LogEntry
   objects.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][11]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
-   `method` **[string][7]** The log function that was used to create the log.

-   `target` **[Object][6]** The subject that the log is about.
    -   `target.name` **[string][7]** The name of the target. This is also
           used as the name of the Logger.
    -   `target.id` **[string][7]?** A unique identifer for the target.
-   `messages` **[Array][12]** The logged information, given to the Logger
       method as parameters.

**Examples**

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, method, target } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.name} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][61]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][62] API.

### getDevices

   information.

Presence information is persisted by the server. When the SDK is initialized,
   there will be no information available. Presence information will become
   available either by using [presence.fetch][67] or by subscribing for
   updates about other Users, using [presence.subscribe][68].

Available presence information can be retrieved using [presence.get][69] or
   [presence.getAll][70].

const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[call.SdpHandlerFunction][15]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## sip

The 'sip' namespace allows a user to subscribe to, and receive notifications for, sip events.

SipEvents functions are all part of this namespace.

### subscribe

Subscribe for a sip event.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][7]** The sip event type to subscribe for.
-   `subscribeUserList` **[Array][12]** The list of users to subcribe to.
-   `clientCorrelator` **[string][7]** 
-   `customParameters` **[Array][12]?** List of custom options provided as part of the subscription.

### update

Update a subscription for a sip event.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][7]** The sip event subscription to update.
-   `userLists` **[Object][6]** 
    -   `userLists.subscribeUserList` **[Array][12]** The list of users to subcribe to.
    -   `userLists.unsubscribeUserList` **[Array][12]** The list of users to unsubscribe from. If all users are unsubscribed from, the event subscription is removed completly.
-   `customParameters` **[Array][12]?** List of custom options provided as part of the subscription.

### unsubscribe

Unsubscribe from a sip event.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][7]** The sip event to unsubscribe from.

### getDetails

Retrieve information about a specified sip event.

**Parameters**

-   `eventType` **[string][7]?** Type of sip event to retrieve.

Returns **[Object][6]** Returns all information related to the chosen eventType that is contained in the store. If no eventType is specified, it will return information for all eventTypes.

## user

The 'user' namespace allows access to user information for users within the same domain.

### User

The User data object.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `userId` **user.UserID** The User ID of the user.
-   `emailAddress` **[string][7]** The email address of the user.
-   `firstName` **[string][7]** The first name of the user.
-   `lastName` **[string][7]** The last name of the user.
-   `photoURL` **[string][7]** The URL to get the photo of the user.
-   `buddy` **[string][7]** Whether the user is a "buddy". Values can be "true" or "false".

### fetch

Fetches information about a User.

The SDK will emit a [users:change][79]
   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

Information about an available User can be retrieved using the
   [user.get][80] API.

**Parameters**

-   `userId` **[string][7]** The User ID of the user.

### fetchSelfInfo

Fetches information about the current User from directory.
Compared to [user.fetch][81] API, this API retrieves additional user related information.

The SDK will emit a [users:change][79]
   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

Information about an available User can be retrieved using the
   [user.get][80] API.

### get

Retrieves information about a User, if available.

See the [user.fetch][81] and [user.search][82] APIs for details about
   making Users' information available.

**Parameters**

-   `userId` **user.UserID** The User ID of the user.

Returns **[user.User][83]** The User object for the specified user.

### getAll

Retrieves information about all available Users.

See the [user.fetch][81] and [user.search][82] APIs for details about
   making Users' information available.

Returns **[Array][12]&lt;[user.User][83]>** An array of all the User objects.

### search

Searches the domain's directory for Users.

Directory searching only supports one filter. If multiple filters are provided, only one of the filters will be used for the search.
A search with no filters provided will return all users.

The SDK will emit a [directory:change][84]
   event after the operation completes. The search results will be
   provided as part of the event, and will also be available using the
   [user.get][80] and [user.getAll][85] APIs.

**Parameters**

-   `filters` **[Object][6]** The filter options for the search.
    -   `filters.userId` **user.UserID?** Matches the User ID of the user.
    -   `filters.name` **[string][7]?** Matches the firstName or lastName.
    -   `filters.firstName` **[string][7]?** Matches the firstName.
    -   `filters.lastName` **[string][7]?** Matches the lastName.
    -   `filters.userName` **[string][7]?** Matches the userName.
    -   `filters.phoneNumber` **[string][7]?** Matches the phoneNumber.

## voicemail

The 'voicemail' namespace is used to retrieve and view
voicemail indicators.

Voicemail functions are all part of this namespace.

### fetch

Attempts to retrieve voicemail information from the server.
A `voicemail:new` event is emitted upon completion.

### get

Returns voicemail data from the store.
